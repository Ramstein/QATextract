EXPLAIN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OF THE CEMENT WITH
NEAT DIAGRAM. GIVE COMPARISON BETWEEN WET AND DRY PROCESS OF
MANUFACTURING.
ANSWER
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES : FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS OF
MANUFACTURING OF CEMENT :
A.
MAKE CLINKERS : IN THIS STEP, THE RAW MATERIAL IS CONVERTED INTO FINE
POWDER AND IT IS DONE BY FOLLOWING TWO PROCESSES :
1
DRY PROCESS :
I
IN THIS PROCESS CALCAREOUS MATERIAL SUCH AS LIMESTONE (CALCIUM
CARBONATE) AND ARGILLACEOUS MATERIAL SUCH AS CLAY ARE GROUND SEPARATELY
TO FINE POWDER IN THE ABSENCE OF WATER AND THEN ARE MIXED TOGETHER IN
THE DESIRED PROPORTIONS.
IL
WATER IS THEN ADDED TO IT FOR GETTING THICK PASTE AND THEN ITS CAKES ARE
FORMED, DRIED AND BURNT IN KILNS.
IN
THIS PROCESS IS USUALLY USED WHEN RAW MATERIALS ARE VERY STRONG AND
HARD.
IV.
IN THIS PROCESS, THE RAW MATERIALS ARE CHANGED TO POWDERED FORM IN THE
ABSENCE OF WATER.
2
WET PROCESS :
I.
IN THIS PROCESS, THE RAW MATERIALS ARE CHANGED TO POWDERED FORM IN THE
PRESENCE OF WATER.
II
IN THIS PROCESS, RAW MATERIALS ARE PULVERIZED BY USING A BALL MILL, WHICH
IS A ROTARY STEEL CYLINDER WITH HARDENED STEEL BALLS.
III.
WHEN THE MILL ROTATES, STEEL BALLS PULVERIZE THE RAW MATERIALS WHICH
FORM SLURRY (LIQUID MIXTURE).
IV.
THE SLURRY IS THEN PASSED INTO STORAGE TANKS, WHERE CORRECT
PROPORTIONING IS DONE.
V.
PROPER COMPOSITION OF RAW MATERIALS CAN BE ENSURED BY USING WET
PROCESS THAN DRY PROCESS.
VI. THIS PROCESS IS GENERALLY USED WHEN RAW MATERIALS ARE SOFT BECAUSE
COMPLETE MIXING IS NOT POSSIBLE UNLESS WATER IS ADDED.
VII. CORRECTED SLURRY IS THEN FED INTO ROTARY KILN FOR BURNING.
THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF BOTH PROCESSES IS TO CHANGE THE RAW MATERIALS TO
FINE POWDER.

1-6 D ()
CEMENT PRODUCTION AND AGGREGATES
B. BURNING :
I.
CORRECTED SLURRY IS FEED TO ROTARY KILN. WHICH IS A 150-500 FEET LONG,
8-16 FEET IN DIAMETER AND TEMPERATURE ARRANGEMENT IS UP TO
1500-1650�C.
II.
AT THIS TEMPERATURE SLURRY LOSSES MOISTURE AND FORMS INTO SMALL LUMPS,
AFTER THAT CHANGES TO CLINKERS.
III.
CLINKERS ARE COOLED IN ANOTHER INCLINED TUBE SIMILAR TO KILN BUT OF LESSER
LENGTH.
C. GRINDING :
I.
NOW THE FINAL PROCESS IS APPLIED WHICH IS GRINDING OF CLINKER, IT IS FIRST
COOLED DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE.
II.
GRINDING OF CLINKER IS DONE IN LARGE TUBE MILLS. AFTER PROPER GRINDING
GYPSUM (CALCIUM SULPHATE CASO, IN THE RATIO OF 01-04 % IS ADDED FOR
CONTROLLING THE SETTING TIME OF CEMENT.
III.
FINALLY, FINE GROUND CEMENT IS STORED IN STORAGE TANKS FROM WHERE IT IS
DRAWN FOR PACKING.

IN CONTACT WITH WATER. IT IS AN EXOTHERMIC REACTION.
4.
THE HYDRATION CONTINUES AS LONG AS HEAT AND MOISTURE ARE AVAILABLE.

CONCRETE
1-9 D()
5. ALL FOUR BEGUE'S COMPOUNDS ALONG WITH GYPSUM ARE INVOLVED IN THE
BYDRATION AND ENLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER IS NEEDED FOR
E
E. FOLLOWING STAGES OCCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF HYDRATION :
1.
STAGE 1 : A BEAT GENERATION OF RAPID ORDER TAKES PLACE FOR CLOSE TO
15 MINUTES THE CALCRUM AND HYDROGEN IONS ARE RELEASED FROM THE
AND WHEN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CRITICAL CONCENTRATIONS ARE REACHED,
THE OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE AND CALCIUM SILICATE HYDROXIDE BEINGS.
THE INSTIMAL REACTIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE TEMPERATURE.
2
STAGE 2 THE STAGE TENDS TO BE THE DORMANT PERIOD AND THE CEMENT IS
FORCED TO BECOME PLASTIC FOR A PERIOD OF 2 TO 4 HOURS. THIS PROCESS OF
REACTION TENDS TO SLEW DOWN
I
STAGE 3: THIS 15 THE ACCELERATION PERIOD AS THE SILICATE HYDRATES RAPIDLY
ALONG WITH CRITICAL CONCENTRATION OF IONS. THE ENTIRE HARDENING TAKES
PLACE AND THE FINAL SET IN RELEASED AND THE TIME PERIOD IS GENERALLY FOR 4
TO . HOURS
4.
STAGE 4 : THUS IS KNOWN AS THE DECELERATION STAGE. THE OVERALL RATE OF
REACTION TENDS TO SLOW DOWN RESULTING IN AN INDEPENDENT DIFFUSION
REATUON
S
STAGE 5: THIS IS REFERRED TO AS THE STEADY STAGE AND THE TEMPERATURE
HAS EFFECT ON THE HYDRATION STAGE. THE REACTION PROCESS IS CONSTANT
AND 15 FOR A PERIOD OF 12 TO 24 HOURS.
THE INDIVIDUAL REACTION OF MINERALS TENDS TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE
COMBUNED REACTION OF THE HYDRATION OF CEMENT. THE HYDRATION OF CEMENT
CAN BE SPLAT ANTO SEVERAL SMALL COMPONENTS IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE
ALUMINATE AND THE FERRITE STAGE TEND TO REACT FIRST AND THEN THE REACTIONS
TEND TO CARRY OVER TO THE SILICATE PHASE.

STRENGTH POINT OF VIEW BUT AGGREGATE HAVING ROUGH SURFACE TEXTURE
PERFORM BETTER UNDER FLEXURAL AND TENSILE STRESSES.
QUE 1.17.
WHAT IS ALKALI AGGREGATE REACTION ? WHAT ARE THE FACTORS
WHICH AFFECT THIS REACTION ? HOW CAN THIS REACTION BE CONTROLLED ?
ANSWER
A.
ALKALI AGGREGATE REACTION :
1.
THE PHENOMENON IS ACCOMPANIED BY EXTENSIVE EXPANSION AND MAY
LEAD IN BAD CASES TO COMPLETE DISRUPTION AND DISINTEGRATION OF THE
CONCRETE AND IS KNOWN AS ALKALI-AGGREGATE REACTION OR SOMETIMES
CONCRETE CANCER.
2
THE TROUBLE IS DUE TO REACTION BETWEEN SILICA IN AGGREGATE AND ALKALIS IN
THE CEMENT.
3.
IN SOME CASES ALKALIS, MAINLY FROM THE CEMENT SUPPLEMENTED BY ALKALIS
IN THE AGGREGATE, REACT WITH CARBONATES IN THE AGGREGATE TO PRODUCE
SIMILAR RESULT.
4.
THE TYPES OF ROCKS WHICH CONTAIN REACTIVE CONSTITUENTS INCLUDE TRAPS,
ANDESITES, RHYOLITES, SILICEOUS LIMESTONE AND CERTAIN TYPES OF SANDSTONES.
5.
THE REACTIVE COMPONENTS MAY BE IN THE FORM OF OPALS, CHERTS,
CHALCEDONY, VOLCANIC GLASS (EXCEPTING BASALTIC GLASSES), ZEOLITES, AND
TRIDYMITE.
B.
FACTORS AFFECTING ALKALI-AGGREGATE REACTION :
1.
REACTIVE TYPE OF AGGREGATES : REACTIVE MATERIAL HAVE BEEN FOUND
TO HAVE SERIOUS EFFECTS IF PRESENT IN SMALL QUANTITIES BUT NOT IF IT
CONSTITUTES THE WHOLE OF THE AGGREGATE.
2
HIGH ALKALI CONTENT CEMENT : IF THE CEMENT CONTAINS LESS THAN
0.4 % ALKALIS (COMPUTED AS NA,O) NO EXPANSION OR DISRUPTIVE EFFECT IS
LIKELY EVEN WITH A QUITE HIGHLY REACTIVE AGGREGATE, BUT DUE TO DIFFICULTIES
OF MANUFACTURE IT IS NOT USUAL TO SPECIFY AN ALKALI CONTENT OF LESS THAN
0.6%.
3.
AVAILABILITY OF MOISTURE : PROGRESS OF THE IKALI-AGGREGATE REACTION
TAKES PLACE ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER.
4.
TEMPERATURE CONDITION : THE FAVOURABLE TEMPERATURE FOR THE
REACTION IS 10-38 �
C. CONTROL OF ALKALI-AGGREGATE REACTION :
1.
BY SELECTING NON-REACTIVE AGGREGATE : AGGREGUTE CAN BE IDENTIFIED
BY PETROGRAPHIC EXAMINATION. THE MORTAR BAR TEST AND THE CHEMICAL
TEST ARE USED.

1-20 D ()
CEMENT PRODUCTION AND AGGREGATES
2.
BY USING LOW ALKALI CEMENT : CEMENTS WITH ALKALI LESS THAN
0.6 PER CENT SHOULD BE USED.
3.
BY CONTROLLING MOISTURE : OLD CONCRETE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO
COME IN CONTACT WITH WATER. THE BEST WAY IS TO APPLY MORTAR WITH WATER
PROOFING AGENTS ON CONCRETE SURFACE.
4.
BY POZZOLANAS : WHEN FLY-ASH OR SURKHI OR CRUSHED STONE DUST IS
ADDED THIS OPTIMUM CONDITION OF SILICA BEING IN PARTICULAR PROPORTION
AND FINENESS IS DISTURBED AND THE AGGREGATES TURN TO BE INOFFENSIVE.
5.
BY AIR ENTRAINING AGENTS : THE ALKALI-SILICA-GEL IMPARTS OSMOTIC
PRESSURE OVER THE SET CEMENT GEL AND THIS IS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
FORMATION OF CRACKS. WHEN AIR ENTRAINING AGENTS ARE ADDED THEY ABSORB
THE OSMOTIC PRESSURE AND CONTROL THE EXPANSION.

WHAT TESTS ARE USED TO FIND OUT THE SHAPE OF THE
AGGREGATE ?
ANSWER
THERE ARE MAINLY TWO TYPES OF TEST FOR FINDING THE SHAPE OF AGGREGATE,
WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS :
A.
TEST FOR DETERMINATION OF FLAKINESS INDEX :
1.
THE FLAKINESS INDEX OF AGGREGATE IS THE PERCENTAGE BY WEIGHT OF PARTICLES
IN IT WHOSE LEAST DIMENSION (THICKNESS) IS LESS THAN THREE-FIFTHS OF THEIR
MEAN DIMENSION. THE TEST IS NOT APPLICABLE TO SIZES SMALLER THAN
6.3 MM.
2.
THIS TEST IS CONDUCTED BY USING A METAL THICKNESS GAUGE.
3.
A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF AGGREGATE IS TAKEN SUCH THAT A MINIMUM NUMBER
OF 200 PIECES OF ANY FRACTION CAN BE TESTED.

1-22 D ()
CEMENT PRODUCTION AND AGGREGATES
4.
EACH FRACTION IS GAUGED IN TURN FOR THICKNESS ON THE METAL GAUGE.
5.
THE TOTAL AMOUNT PASSING IN THE GAUGE IS WEIGHED TO AN ACCURACY OF
0.1 % OF THE WEIGHT OF THE SAMPLES TAKEN.
6.
THE FLAKINESS INDEX IS TAKEN AS THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE MATERIAL PASSING
THE VARIOUS THICKNESS GAUGES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL
WEIGHT OF THE SAMPLE TAKEN.
B.
TEST FOR DETERMINNTION OF ELONGATION INDEX :
1.
THE ELONGATION INDEX ON AN AGGREGATE IS THE PERCENTAGE BY WEIGHT OF
PARTICLES WHOSE GREATEST DIMENSION (LENGTH) IS GREATER THAN 1.8 TIMES
THEIR MEAN DIMENSION.
2.
THE ELONGATION INDEX IS NOT APPLICABLE TO SIZES SMALLER THAN 6.3 MM.
3.
THIS TEST IS CONDUCTED BY USING METAL LENGTH GAUGE.
4.
A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF AGGREGATE IS TAKEN TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM
NUMBER OF 200 PIECES OF ANY FRACTION TO BE TESTED.
5.
EACH FRACTION SHALL BE GAUGED INDIVIDUALLY FOR LENGTH ON THE METAL
GAUGE.
6.
THE TOTAL AMOUNT RETAINED BY THE GAUGE LENGTH SHALL BE WEIGHED TO AN
ACCURACY OF AT LEAST 0.1 % OF THE WEIGHT OF THE TEST SAMPLES TAKEN.
7.
THE ELONGATION INDEX IS THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE MATERIAL RETAINED ON THE
VARIOUS LENGTH GAUGES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF
THE SAMPLE GAUGED.

EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF 'TEN PERCENT
FINES VALUE'.
ANSWER
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF TEN PERCENT FINES VALUE :
1.
THE SAMPLE OF AGGREGATE FOR THIS TEST IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE SAMPLE
USED FOR AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE TEST.
2.
THE APPARATUS, WITH THE TEST SAMPLE AND PLUNGER IN POSITION IS PLACED IN
THE COMPRESSION TESTING MACHINE.
3.
THE LOAD IS APPLIED AT A UNIFORM RATE SO AS TO CAUSE A TOTAL PENETRATION
OF THE PLUNGER IN 10 MINUTES OF ABOUT :
I.
15 MM FOR ROUNDED OR PARTIALLY ROUNDED AGGREGATES (FOR EXAMPLE
UNCRUSHED GRAVELS)
II.
20.0 MM FOR NORMAL CRUSHED AGGREGATES, AND
III.
24.0 MM FOR HONEYCOMBED AGGREGATES (E.G., EXPANDED SHALES AND
STAGS).
4.
AFTER REACHING THE REQUIRED MAXIMUM PENETRATION, THE LOAD IS RELEASED
AND THE WHOLE OF THE MATERIAL REMOVED FROM THE CYLINDER AND SIEVED ON
A 2.36 MM IS SIEVE.
5.
THE FINES PASSING THE SIEVE IS WEIGHED AND THE WEIGHT IS EXPRESSED AS
A PERCENTAGE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE TEST SAMPLE.

WHAT IS FINENESS MODULUS ? HOW IS SIEVE ANALYSIS
CONDUCTED FOR FINE AGGREGATES AND COARSE AGGREGATES ?
ANSWER
A.
FINENESS MODULUS (FM) :
1.
THE FM IS AN INDEX OF THE FINENESS OF THE AGGREGATE. THE HIGHER THE FM
THE COARSER THE AGGREGATE. FM OF FINE AGGREGATE IS USEFUL IN ESTIMATING
PROPORTIONS OF FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE MIXTURES.
2
THE FINENESS MODULUS (FM) FOR BOTH FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATES IS
OBTAINED BY ADDING THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGES BY MASS RETAINED ON
EACH OF A SPECIFIED SERIES OF SIEVES AND DIVIDING THE SUM BY 100.

THIS IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE OPERATION OF DIVIDING A SAMPLE OF AGGREGATE
INTO VARIOUS FRACTIONS EACH CONSISTING OF PARTICLES OF THE SAME SIZE.
2.
THE SIEVE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION
IN A SAMPLE OF AGGREGATE, WHICH WE CALL GRADATION.
3.
THE AGGREGATES USED FOR MAKING CONCRETE ARE NORMALLY OF THE MAXIMUM
SIZE 80 MM, 40 MM, 20 MM, 10 MM, 4.75 MM, 2.36 MM, 600 MICRON,
300 MICRON AND 150 MICRON. THE AGGREGATE FRACTION FROM 80 MM TO
4.75 MM IS TERMED AS COARSE AGGREGATE AND THE FRACTION FROM
4.75 MM TO 150 MICRON IS TERMED AS FINE AGGREGATE.
4.
AS PER IS : 2386() : FINE AGGREGATE : 6 STANDARD SIEVES WITH
OPENINGS FROM 150 UM TO 4.75 MM. (150 UM, 300 UM, 600 UM, 1.18 MM,
2.36 MM, 4.75 MM).
5.
COARSE AGGREGATE : 5 SIEVES WITH OPENINGS FROM 4.75 MM TO 80 MM.
(4.75 MM, 10 MM, 12.5 MM, 20 MM, 40 MM).

EXPLAIN DIFFERENT METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF MOISTURE
CONTENT OF AGGREGATES.
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF MOISTURE CEMENT OF
AGGREGATES
1.
DRYING METHOD :
I.
THE APPLICATION OF DRYING METHOD IS FAIRLY SIMPLE. DRYING IS CARRIED OUT
IN AN OVEN AND THE LOSS IN WEIGHT BEFORE AND AFTER DRYING WILL GIVE THE
MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE AGGREGATE.
II.
IF THE DRYING IS DONE COMPLETELY AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR A LONG TIME,
THE LOSS IN WEIGHT WILL INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE SURFACE WATER BUT ALSO SOME
ABSORBED WATER.
III.
A FAIRLY QUICK RESULT CAN BE OBTAINED BY HEATING THE AGGREGATE QUICKLY
IN AN OPEN PAN.
IV.
THE PROCESS CAN ALSO BE SPEEDED UP BY POURING INFLAMMABLE LIQUID SUCH
AS METHYLATED SPIRIT OR ACETONE OVER THE AGGREGATE AND IGNITING IT.
2.
DISPLACEMENT METHOD :
I.
IN THE LABORATORY THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF AGGREGATE CAN BE DETERMINED
BY MEANS OF PYCNOMETER OR BY USING SIPHON-CAN METHOD.
II.
THE PRINCIPLE MADE USE OF IS THAT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF NORMAL AGGREGATE
IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF WATER AND THAT A GIVEN WEIGHT OF WET AGGREGATE
WILL OCCUPY A GREATER VOLUME THAN THE SAME WEIGHT OF THE AGGREGATE
WHEN DRY.
III.
BY KNOWING THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE DRY AGGREGATE, THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY
OF THE WET AGGREGATE CAN BE CALCULATED.
IV.
FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THE DRY AND WET
AGGREGATES, THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE AGGREGATE CAN BE CALCULATED.
3.
ELECTRICAL METER METHOD :
I.
RECENTLY ELECTRICAL METERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO MEASURE
INSTANTANEOUS OR CONTINUOUS READING OF THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE
AGGREGATE.
II.
THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE RESISTANCE GETS CHANGED WITH THE CHANGE IN
MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE AGGREGATE HAS BEEN MADE USE OF.
4.
AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENT :
1.
IN MODERN BATCHING PLANTS SURFACE MOISTURE IN AGGREGATES IS
AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED BY MEANS OF SOME KIND OF SENSOR ARRANGEMENT.


1-25 D ()
2.
THE ARRANGEMENT IS MADE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE QUANTITY OF FREE WATER
GOING WITH AGGREGATE IS AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED AND SIMULTANEOUSLY
THAT MUCH QUANTITY OF WATER IS REDUCED.

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF IMPURITIES IN THE MIXING WATER
ON CONCRETE ?
OR
WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON THE FEASIBILITY OF USE OF SEA WATER FOR MIXING
CONCRETE.
ANSWER
EFFECTS OF MIXING WATER FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES :
1.
GROUND WATER : PRESENCE OF SULPHATES IN GROUND WATERS HIGHLY
INJURIOUS TO CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS.
2
SEA WATER
I
THE SEA WATER GENERALLY CONTAINS 3.5 % OF SALTS WITH ABOUT 75 % OF
SODIUM CHLORIDE, ABOUT 15 % OF CHLORIDE AND SULPHATE OF MAGNESIUM.
II.
IT HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE BY 10-20 % AND
SLIGHTLY ACCELERATE THE SETTING TIME.
III.
SEA WATER MAY LEAD TO CORROSION OF REINFORCEMENT.
IV.
THE CHLORIDES IN SEA WATER MAY CAUSE EFFLORESCENCE IN CONCRETE.
V.
THE USE OF SEA WATER IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRESTRESSED CONCRETE

AIR-ENTRAINMENT IS THE INTERNAL CREATION OF TINY AIR BUBBLES IN CONCRETE.
A CONCRETE MAKER INTRODUCES THE BUBBLES BY ADDING TO THE MIX AN AIR
ENTRAINING AGENT. THE AIR BUBBLES ARE CREATED DURING MIXING OF THE
PLASTIC CONCRETE AND MOST OF THEM SURVIVE TO BE PART OF THE HARDENED
CONCRETE.
2.
IT CONTAINS BILLIONS OF MICROSCOPIC AIR CELLS PER CUBIC FONT. THESE NIR POCKETS
RELIEVE INTERNAL PRESSURE ON THE CONCRETE BY PROVIDING TINY CHAMBERS FOR
WATER TO EXPAND INTO WHEN IT FREEZES.

OF FRESH AND HARDENED CONCRETE.
ANSWER
A.
EFFECT ON FRESH CONCRETE:
1.
SUPERPLASTICIZERS ENHANCE WORKABILITY. THE EFFECT DEPENDS ON TYPE,
DOSAGE, AND TIME OF ADDITION (BEST WITH MIXING WATER). WATER REQUIREMENT
IS REDUCED BY 15 TO 30 %6. RESULTING CONCRETE HAS HIGHER STRENGTH AND
LOWER PERMEABILITY.
2.
SUPERPLASTICIZERS PRODUCE HIGHER THAN NORMAL WORKABILITY FOR 30-60 MIN

WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS AND ALSO WRITE DOWN THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
OF THE SLAG GGBS.
ANSWER
A.
GROUND GRANULATED BLAST FURNACE SLAG (GGBS) :
1.
THE BLAST FURNACE SLAG IS A BYPRODUCT OF THE IRON MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY.
IRON ORE, COKE AND LIMESTONE ARE FED INTO THE FURNACE AND THE RESULTING
MOLTEN SLAG FLOATS ABOVE THE MOLTEN IRON AT A TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT
1500 �C TO 1600 �C.

WATER DEMAND : GGBS IS A GLASSY MATERIAL AND ITS SMOOTHER SURFACE
REQUIRES LESS WATER TO ADEQUATELY COVER THE PARTICLES.
3.
SETTING TIME : INCREASED SETTING TIME MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN EXTENDING
THE TIME FOR WHICH THE CONCRETE REMAINS WORKABLE AND, MAY REDUCE THE
RISK OF COLD JOINTS.
4. APPEARANCE
I.
GGBS CEMENT ALSO PRODUCES A SMOOTHER, MORE DEFECT FREE SURFACE, DUE
TO THE FINENESS OF THE GGBS PARTICLES.
II.
GGBS IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING EFFLORESCENCE WHEN USED AT REPLACEMENT
LEVELS OF 50 % TO 60 %.

5.
BLEEDING : GGBS REDUCE BLEEDING THAN THAT OF PORTLAND CEMENT AND
THEREFORE REDUCES RISK OF DELAMINATIONS.
6.
WORKABILITY : GGBS PARTICLES ARE LESS WATER ABSORPTIVE THAN PORTLAND
CEMENT PARTICLES AND THUS GGBS CONCRETE IS MORE WORKABLE THAN
PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE. FOR EQUIVALENT WORKABILITY, A REDUCTION IN
WATER CONTENT OF UP TO 10% IS POSSIBLE.
7.
SULPHATE RESISTANCE : GGBS IS N SULPHATE-RESISTING. SPECIFYING GGBS
AT 50 %-70% CONTENT GIVES OPTIMUM PROTECTION AGAINST SULPHATE ATTACK.
8.
ALKALI AGGREGATE REACTION (AAR) : GGBS REDUCE THE DELETERIOUS

THE STABILITY OF CONCRETE IS MEASURED BY ITS SEGREGATION AND BLEEDING
CHARACTERISTIRS.
2 MOBILITY =
I
THE MOBILITY OF FRESH CONCRETE IS ITS ABILITY TO FLOW UNDER MOMENTUM
TRANSFER. IEM UNDER MECHANICAL STRESSES. THE FLOW IS RESTRICTED BY
COHESIVE, VISCOUS AND FRICTIONAL FORCES.
IL
THE COBESIVE FORCE DEVELOPS DUE TO ADHESION BETWEEN THE MATRIX AND
AGGREGATE PARTICLES. IT PROVIDES TENSILE STRENGTH OF FRESH CONCRETE THAT
RESISTS SEGREGATION.
EI. THE VISCOSITY OF THE MATRIX CONTRIBUTES TO THE EASE WITH WHICH THE
AGGREGATE PARTICLES CAN MOVE AND REARRANGE THEMSELVES WITHIN THE
MATRIX.
IV.
THE INTERNAL FRIETION OCCURS WHEN A MIZTURE IS DISPLACED AND THE
AGREGATE PARTICLES TRANSLATE AND ROTATE.
V.
THE RESISTANCE TO DEFORMATION DEPENDS ON THE SHAPE AND TEXTURE OF THE
AGREGATE, THE RICHNESS OF THE MIXTURE, THE WATER-CEMENT RATIO, AND
THE TYPE OF CEMENT USED.

QUE 3.10.
DESCRIBE THE BINGHAM MODEL OF RHEOLOGY OF FRESH
CONCRETE.
ANSWER
1.
THE FLOW BEHAVIOUR OF FRESH CONCRETE DOES NOT CONFORM TO NEWTONIAN
LIQUID.
2.
THE RATIO OF SHEAR STRESS TO SHEAR RATE IS NOT CONSTANT BUT DEPENDS UPON
THE SHEAR RATE AT WHICH IT IS MEASURED, AND MAY ALSO DEPEND ON THE
SHEAR HISTORY OF THE CONCRETE SAMPLE BEING INVESTIGATED.
3.
HOWEVER, AT LOW SHEAR RATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN PRACTICE, THE
BEHAVIOUR CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A STRAIGHT LINE WHICH DOES NOT PASS
THROUGH-THE ORIGIN, I.E., WHICH HAS AN INTERCEPT ON THE STRESS AXIS.
4.
THE INTERCEPT INDICATES THE MINIMUM STRESS BELOW WHICH NO FLOW OCCURS.
5.
THE FACT THAT CONCRETE CAN STAND IN A PILE (AS IN THE CASE OF THE SLUMP
TEST) SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS SOME MINIMUM STRESS NECESSARY FOR FLOW TO
OCCUR AT ALL.
6.
THE MINIMUM STRESS IS CALLED YIELD STRESS AND DESIGNATED BY THE SYMBOL

TO STABLISH A STRAIGHT LINE, AT LEAST TWO POINTS ARE REQUIRED. ACCORDINGLY,
THE WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE SINGLE-POINT TESTS
THAT DETERMINE ONLY ONE PARAMETER, I.E., PRODUCE ONLY SINGLE POINT, AND
THEREFORE HAVE TO BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER TESTS TO ACHIEVE A
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CONCRETE RHEOLOGY.

TO MEASURE MOBILITY AND COMPACTABILITY.
QUE 3.11.
EXPLAIN THE AFFECTIVE FACTORS OF RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
OF CONCRETE.
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE AFFECTING FACTORS OF RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE :
1.
MIX PROPORTION : A CONCRETE MIX HAVING AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF COARSE
AGGREGATE WILLLACK SUFFICIENT MORTAR TO FILL THE VOID SYSTEM, RESULTING IN
A LOSS OF COHESION AND MOBILITY.
2
CONSISTENCY THE CONSISTENCY OF CONCRETE, AS MEASURED BY THE SLUMP
TEST, IS AN INDICATOR OF THE RELATIVE WATER CONTENT IN THE CONCRETE MIX.
3
HARDENING AND STIFFENING :
I
ELEVATED TEMPERATURE, USE OF RAPID-HARDENING CEMENT, CEMENT DEFICIENT
IN GYPSUM, AND USE OF ACCELERATING ADMIXTURES, INCREASE THE RATE OF
HARDENING WHICH REDUCES THE MOBILITY OF CONCRETE.
IL
THE DRY AND POROUS AGGREGATE WILL RAPIDLY REDUCE WORKABILITY BY
ABSORBING WATER FROM THE MIXTURE OR INCREASING THE SURFACE AREA TO BE
WETTED.
4.
AGGREGATE SHAPE AND TEXTURE :
I.
THE ROUGH AND HIGHLY ANGULAR AGGREGATE PARTICLES WILL RESULT IN HIGHER
PERCENTAGE OF VOIDS BEING FILLED BY MORTAR, REQUIRING HIGHER FINE
AGGREGATE CONTENTS AND CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER WATER CONTENT.
II.
SIMILARLY, AN ANGULAR FINE AGGREGATE WILL INCREASE INTERNAL FRICTION IN
THE CONCRETE MIXTURE AND REQUIRE HIGHER WATER CONTENT THAN
WELL-ROUNDED NATURAL SAND.
5.
AGGREGATE GRADING: A WELL-GRADED AGGREGATE GIVES GOOD WORKABILITY.
THESE EFFECTS ARE GREATER IN THE FINE AGGREGATE THAN IN COARSE AGGREGATE.
6.
MAXIMUM AGGREGATE SIZE : AN INCREASE IN THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF
AGGREGATE WILL REDUCE THE FINE AGGREGATE CONTENT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A
GIVEN WORKABILITY. AND WILL THEREBY REDUCE THE SURFACE AREA TO BE WETTED.
7.
ADMIXTURES : THE ADMIXTURES WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE
RHEOLOGY OF CONCRETE ARE PLASTICIZERN AND MUPER-PLUSTICIZERS, AIR-
ENTRAINING AGENTS, ACCELERATORN AND RETARDERS.

QUE 4.1.
EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS STEPS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF
CONCRETE.
ANSWER
THA VARIOUS STAGES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CONCRETE ARE AS FOLLOWS :
1.
BATCHING OF CONCRETE : BATCHING IS THE PROCESS OF MEASURING CONCRETE
MAX INGREDIENTE BY EITHER MASS OR VOLUME AND INTRODUCING THEM INTO THE
MIXER TO PRODUCE CONCRETE OF UNIFORM QUALITY, THE INGREDIENTS MUST BE
MEASURED ACCURATELY FOR EACH BATCH.


4-3 DI)
THE TWN METHODS OF BATCHING ARE AS FOLLOWS
I.
VOLUME BATCHING :
A.
VOLUME BATCHING IS NOT A GOND METHOD BECAUSE OF THE INACCURACIES IT
INTRODUCES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF GRANULAR MATERIALS
B.
LOOSE SAND IN A MOIST CONDITION OCCUPIES MORE VOLUME THAN DRY COMPACTED
SAND DUE TO THE PHENOMENON OF BULKING. HENCE, THE EFFECT OF BULKING
MUST BE CONSIDERED WHILE MEASURING SAND.
C.
DESPITE DRAWBACKS, FOR LESS IMPORTANT NON-ENGINEERED SMALL WORKS.
THIS METHOD IS ADOPTED BECAUSE OF ITS EASE IN APPLICATION. HOWEVER. IT IS
UNSCIENTIFIC AND HENCE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR IMPORTANT WORKS.
II.
WEIGH BATCHING :
A.
WEIGH BATCHING IS THE CORRECT METHOD OF MEASURING THE MATERIALS THAT
ARE USED TO MAKE CONCRETE.
B.
USE OF WEIGH BATCHING SYSTEM FACILITATES ACCURACY, FLEXIBILITY. AND
SIMPLICITY.
C.
FOR LARGE WORKS, A WEIGH BATCHING PLANT IS USED.
2
MIXING THE MIXING SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE MASS BECOMES HOMOGENEOUS,
UNIFORM IN COLOUR AND CONSISTENCY.
METHODS OF MIXING :
I.
HAND MIXING.
II.
MACHINE MIXING.
3.
TRANSPORTING : IT IS THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING OF CONCRETE FROM THE
MIXING PLANT TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE. IT CAN BE DONE BY FOLLOWING
EQUIPMENTS :
I.
MORTAR PAN : CONCRETE IS CARRIED IN SMALL QUANTITIES.
II.
WHEELBARROWS AND BUGGIES : SHORT FLAT HAULS ON ALL TYPES OF ONSITE
CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION.
III. CRANES AND BUCKETS : USED FOR WORK ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, BUCKETS USE
WITH CRANES, CABLEWAYS, AND HELICOPTERS.
4.
COMPACTION OF CONCRETE :
I.
COMPACTION OF CONCRETE IS PROCESS ADOPTED FOR EXPELLING THE ENTRAPPED
AIR FROM THE CONCRETE.
II.
IN THE PROCESS OF MIXING, TRANSPORTING AND PLACING OF CONCRETE AIR IS
LIKELY TO GET ENTRAPPED IN THE CONCRETE.
III.
IT HAS BEEN FOUND FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES THAT 1 : AIR IN THE
CONCRETE APPROXIMATELY REDUCES THE STRENGTH BY IF
5.
CURING :
I.
IT IS THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE CONCRETE IS PROTECTED FROM LOSS OF MOISTURE
AND KEPT WITHIN A REASONABLE TEMPERATURE RANGE.

D()
CONCRETE PRODUCTION, PROPERTIES AND TESTING
IL THE RESULT OF THIS PROCESS IS INCREASED STRENGTH AND DECREASED
PERMEABILITY.
III. CURING IS ALSO A KEY PLAYER IN MITIGATING CRACKS IN THE CONCRETE, WHICH
SEVERELY IMPACTS DURABILITY.
6. FINISHING :
I.
THE FINISH CAN BE STRICTLY FUNCTIONAL OR DECORATIVE.
N
FINISHING MAKES CONCRETE ATTRACTIVE AND SERVICEABLE.
IIL.
THE FINAL TEXTURE, HARDNESS, ANDJOINT PATTERN ON SLABS, FLOORS, SIDEWALKS,
PATIOS, AND DRIVEWAYS DEPEND ON THE CONCRETE'S END USE.
QUE 4.2.
EXPLAIN THE MIXING AND TRANSPORTING OPERATIONS OF
CONCRETE IN A WORK SITE.
ANSWER
A
METHODS OF MIXING : CONCRETE IS MIXED EITHER BY HAND MIXING OR BY
MACHINE MIXING. BASED ON THE QUANTITY OF CONCRETE REQUIRED.
1.
HAND MIXING :
I.
MIXING BY HAND IS EMPLOYED ONLY FOR SPECIFIC CASES WHERE QUALITY IS NOT OF
MUCH IMPORTANCE, EITHER BECAUSE OF THE UNIMPORTANT NATURE OF THE
WORK OR BECAUSE THE QUANTITY OF CONCRETE REQUIRED IS LESS.
N
HAND MIXING GENERALLY DOES NOT PRODUCE UNIFORM CONCRETE AND HENCE
SHOULD NOT BE NORMALLY USED. UNLESS IT IS FOR VERY SMALL DOMESTIC WORKS.
2
MECHANICAL MIXING =
IL
MECHANICAL MIXERS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN TYPES : BATCH MIXER AND
CONTINUOUS MIXERS.
IL
BATCH MIXERS PRODUCE CONCRETE BATCH BY BATCH, ONE BATCH AT A TIME. THE
OPERATION IS INTERMITTENT. THE RAW MATERIAL IS LOADED AT ONE END AND THE
CONCRETE IS DISCHARGED AT THE OTHER END. THIS CONSTITUTES A CYCLE OF
OPERATION WHICH IS REPEATED UNTIL ENOUGH QUANTITY OF CONCRETE IS
PRODUCED
III.
CONTINUOUS MIXERS PRODUCE CONCRETE AT A SPECIFIED RATE. THE RAW MATERIALS
ARE CONTINUOUSLY ENTERED AT ONE END AND MIXED CONCRETE EXITS FROM THE
DELIVERY END.
B. TRANSPORTATION OF CONCRETE : THE FOLLOWING METHODS ARE USED FOR
TRANSPORTING CONCRETE :
1.
DIRECT DISCHARGE INTO FORMS BY SHORT CHUTES
:
I.
SHORT CHUTES IN A SEMI-CIRCULAR SHAPE STIFFENED AT INTERVALS ARE SIMPLE
AND ECONOMICAL TO USE.
II.
FREE FALL OF CONCRETE FROM A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN 2 M MUST BE AVOIDED.
2
BARROWS :
I.
MANUAL WHEELBARROWS OF APPROXIMATELY 80 KG CAPACITY CAN BE USED FOR
LONG HORIZONTAL DISTANCES.


45 D ()
II.
FOR MAJOR WORKS, POWER BARROWS OF 800 KG CAPACITY, UP TO 300 M HAULS
ARE USED.
3.
DUMPERS AND TRUCKS :
I.
THESE ARE USED FOR HORIZONTAL LONG HAULS.
II.
BECAUSE OF JOLTING, ESPECIALLY IF THE TERRAIN IS ROUGH, THE CONCRETE DURING
TRANSIT HAS THE RISK OF SEGREGATION.
4.
ELEVATING TOWERS AND HOIST : IN MULTI-STORIED BUILDINGS, ELEVATING
TOWERS ARE USED FOR LIFTING CONCRETE BUCKETS. THE LIFTED CONCRETE IS THEN
DISTRIBUTED BY EITHER CHUTES OR BARROWS. THIS TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION CAN
BE USED WHERE HIGH LIFTS ARE REQUIRED.
5.
MONORAIL SYSTEM :
I.
IN TUNNELS AND IN DAM SITES, A SINGLE TRACK IS LAID TO CARRY A MONORAIL
POWER WAGON WHICH MOVES AT A SPEED OF 80 M/MIN.
II.
THIS TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION CAN BE USED FOR COVERING LONG DISTANCES.
6.
CRANES AND CABLEWAYS :
I.
WHEN CONCRETING IS TO BE DONE IN A LARGE PROJECT COVERING MOUNTAINS AND
VALLEYS, CRANES AND CABLEWAYS ARE USED TO PROVIDE THREE-DIMENSIONAL
TRANSPORT ENABLING BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL MOVEMENT.
II.
DEPENDING ON THE SITE CONDITION, THE TYPE OF CRANE CAN BE CHOSEN. IT MAY
BE A DERRICK, CRAWLER, OR WHEEL MOUNTED.
7.
BELT CONVEYOR :
I.
IT CAN BE USED WHEN HAULING CONCRETE OVER LONG DISTANCES.
II.
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF ITS VULNERABILITY TO
SEGREGATION.
III.
THE INITIAL SETTING-UP COST IS ALSO HIGH. DISCHARGE CAN BE AS HIGH AS
115 M�/H.
8.
CONCRETE BUCKET AND SKIP : THE CAPACITY OF THE SKIP VARIES FROM
ABOUT 0.2 M� TO 10 M�.
QUE 4.3.
WHAT ARE THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHILE TRANSPORTING
CONCRETE ? WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE
PUMP ?
ANSWER
A.
PRECAUTIONS IN TRANSPORTING OF CONCRETE : FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS
SHOULD BE USED DURING TRANSPORTING OF CONCRETE :
1.
WHILE WATER IS ADDED TO CEMENT, THE PROCEDURE OF HYDRATION STARTS AND
WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, SO CONCRETE SHOULD BE TRANSPORTED AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE TO THE FORMWORK WITHIN THE INITIAL SETTING TIME OF CEMENT.
2.
THE PROCEDURE OF MIXING, TRANSPORTING, PLACING AND COMPACTING CONCRETE
SHOULD NOT TAKE MORE THAN 90 MINUTES IN ANY CASE.

4-6D ()
CONCRETE PRODUCTION, PROPERTIES AND TESTING
S.
NO WATER SHALL BE LOST FROM THE MIX DURING TRANSPORTATION.
4.
THE CONCRETE COMBINE SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM DRYING IN HOT WEATHER
AND FROM RAIN DURING TRANSPORT FROM THE PLACE OF MIXING TO THE POSITION
OF PLACING.
5.
SEGREGATION OF CONCRETE SHOULD BE AVOIDED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.
6.
THE CONCRETE SHALL BE KEPT AGITATED IN TRUCK MIXER IN ORDER TO AVOID IT
FROM BECOMING STIFFIF MORE TIME IS LIKELY TO BE SPENT DURING TRANSPORTATION.
B. ADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE PUMP :
1. CONCRETE PUMPING IS A FASTER AND EASIER METHOD TO COMPLETE A PROJECT.
2
CONCRETE PUMPING REDUCES LABOUR COSTS.
3.
IT REDUCES SITE CONGESTION AS THERE ARE LESS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.
4.
IT PROVIDES A STEADY WORK PACE, INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY.
5. IT IS EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL FOR VARIOUS SIZED PROJECTS, INCLUDING
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
6.
SEVERAL PUMPS CAN POUR SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR LARGER PROJECTS.
C.
DISADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE PUMP :
1.
POSSIBILITY OF A CONCRETE PUMP BREAKING DOWN.
2
RISK OF INJURY TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.
3.
DURING BUSY PERIODS IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND A CONCRETE PUMP THAT IS
AVAILABLE.
QUE 4.4.
DEFINE WORKABILITY. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE
WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE ?
ANSWER
A.
WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE :
I.
A CONCRETE IS SAID TO BE WORKABLE IF IT IS EASILY TRANSPORTED, PLACED,
COMPACTED AND FINISHED WITHOUT ANY SEGREGATION.
II
WORKABILITY IS A PROPERTY OF FRESHLY MIXED CONCRETE, AND A CONCRETE IS A
MIXTURE OF CEMENT, AGGREGATE, WATER AND ADMIXTURE.
B.
FACTORS AFFECTING OF WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE : FOLLOWING ARE THE
FACTORS AFFECTING OF WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE :
1.
WATER CONTENT : WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE INCREASES WITH INCREASE IN
WATER CONTENT.
2
AGGREGATE/CEMENT RATIO : THE HIGHER THE AGGREGATE/CEMENT RATIO,
THE LEANER IS THE CONCRETE, RESULTING IN LESSER WORKABILITY.
3.
SIZE OF AGGREGATE: FOR A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER AND PASTE, BIGGER SIZE
OF AGGREGATES WILL GIVE HIGHER WORKABILITY.
4.
SHAPE OF AGGREGATE : BETTER WORKABILITY IS ENSURED TO ROUNDED
AGGREGATE THAN ANGULAR, ELONGATED OR FLAKY AGGREGATE.


4-7 D ()
5.
GRADING OF AGGREGATE : THIS IS ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH WILL HAVE
MAXIMUM INFLUENCE ON WORKABILITY. A WELL GRADED AGGREGATE CAN LEAD TO
GOOD WORKABILITY.
G-
SURFACE TEXTURE OF AGGREGATE : ROUGH TEXTURED AGGREGATE WILL SHOW
POOR WORKABILITY AND SMOOTH OR GLASSY TEXTURED AGGREGATE WILL GIVE BETTER
WORKABILITY.
7.
USE OF ADMIXTURE : THE RIGHT WAY OF IMPROVING WORKABILITY IS TO USE
CHEMICAL ADMIXTURES SUCH AS PLASTICIZERS, SUPER PLASTICIZERS, AIR ENTRAINING
AGENTS, ETC.
QUE 4.5.
MENTION THE DIFFERENT TESTS WHICH ARE COMMONLY ADAPTED
TO MEASURE WORKABILITY AND EXPLAIN ANY ONE TEST IN DETAIL.
ANSWER
A.
TEST FOR MEASURE WORKABILITY : FOLLOWING ARE THE TEST USED FOR
MEASURE WORKABILITY :
I.
SLUMP TEST.
II.
COMPACTING FACTOR TEST.
III.
VEE-BEE TEST.
B.
CONCRETE SLUMP TEST PROCEDURE :
1.
FIRSTLY, THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE MOULD IS CLEANED CAREFULLY. OIL CAN BE
APPLIED ON THE SURFACE.
2.
THE MOULD IS THEN PLACED ON A BASE PLATE.
3.
THE MOULD IS FILLED WITH FRESH CONCRETE IN THREE LAYERS. EACH LAYER IS
TAMPED 25 TIMES WITH A STEEL ROD.
4.
AFTER FILLING THE MOULD, EXCESS CONCRETE SHOULD BE REMOVED AND THE
SURFACE SHOULD BE LEVELED.
5.
THEN THE MOULD IS LIFTED GENTLY IN THE VERTICAL DIRECTION AND THEN
UNSUPPORTED CONCRETE WILL SLUMP. THE DECREASE IN HEIGHT AT THE CENTRE
POINT IS MEASURED TO NEAREST 5 MM OR 0.25 INCH AND IT IS KNOWN AS
"SLUMP'.
QUE 4.6.
HOW DO YOU CONDUCT COMPACTING FACTOR TEST IN
LABORATORY.
ANSWER
COMPACTION FACTOR TEST :
1.
THE COMPACTION FACTOR TEST GIVES THE BEHAVIOR OF FRESH CONCRETE UNDER
THE ACTION OF EXTERNAL FORCE.
2.
IN THIS TEST, THE COMPACTION ACHIEVED THROUGH A FREE FALL OF CONCRETE
DETERMINES ITS WORKABILITY.

4-D<)
CONCRETE PRODUCTION, PROPERTIES AND TESTING
COMPACTION FACTOR TEST PROCEDURE :
1.
THE CONCRETE SAMPLE IS PLACED IN THE UPPER HOPPER.
2.
THEN THE DOOR OF HOPPER IS OPENED. THE SAMPLE DROPS INTO LOWER HOPPER
FILLING IT TO OVERFLOWING
3.
THE TRAP DOOR OF THE LOWER HOPPER IS THEN OPENED AND THE SAMPLE FALLS
INTO THE CYLINDER WHICH IS ALSO FILLED TO OVERFLOWING.
4.
THE SURPLUS CONCRETE IS REMOVED FROM THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WITH THE
HELP OF A TROWEL.
5.
THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF CYLINDER IS WIPED AND CLEANED.
6.
THE CYLINDER IS THEN WEIGHED AND IT IS RECORDED AS WEIGHT OF PARTIALLY
COMPACTED CONCRETE.
7.
THE CYLINDER IS AGAIN FILLED WITH CONCRETE IN LAYERS NOT EXCEEDING 50 MM
IN THICKNESS. EACH LAYER IS FULLY COMPACTED WITH TAMPING ROD.
&.
THE CYLINDER IS AGAIN WEIGHED AFTER WIPING AND CLEANING THE OUTSIDE
SURFACE OF CYLINDER. THIS WEIGHT IS RECORDED AS THE WEIGHT OF FULLY
COMPACTED CONCRETE.
9.
THE COMPACTING FACTOR IS THEN CALCULATED FROM THE FORMULA :
COMPACTING FACTOR = WEIGHT OF PARTIALLY COMPACTED CONCRETE/WEIGHT OF
FULLY COMPACTED CONCRETE.
QUE 4.7.
EXPLAIN THE VEE-BEE TEST OF DETERMINING WORKABILITY WITH
NEAT SKETCH.
ANSWER
1. THE TEST IS SUITABLE FOR STIFF CONCRETE MIXES HAVING LOW OR VERY LOW
WORKABILITY.
2.
COMPARED TO THE SLUMP AND COMPACTING FACTOR TESTS, THE VEE-BEE TEST
HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE CONCRETE IN THE TEST RECEIVES A TREATMENT
SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WOULD IN ACTUAL PRACTICE.
3.
THE TEST CONSISTS OF MOULDING A FRESH CONCRETE CONE IN A CYLINDRICAL
CONTAINER MOUNTED ON A VIBRATING TABLE (FIGURE. 4.7.1).
4.
WHEN THE CONCRETE CONE IS SUBJECTED TO VIBRATION USING A STANDARD
VIBRATOR, IT STARTS TO OCCUPY THE CYLINDRICAL CONTAINER BY WAY OF GETTING
REMOULDED.
5.
THE REMOULDING IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WHEN THE CONCRETE SURFACE
BECOMES HORIZONTAL.
6.
THE TIME (IN SECONDS) REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETE REMOULDING IS CONSIDERED
AS A MEASURE OF WORKABILITY AND IS EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF VEE-BEE
SECONDS.
7.
THE END POINT OF THE TEST, WHEN THE CONCRETE SURFACE BECOMES HORIZONTAL,
HAS TO BE ASCERTAINED VISUALLY.

FIGURE. 4.7-1. VEE-BEE APPARATUS.
QUE 4.8.
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF TIME AND TEMPERATURE ON
WORKABILITY ?
ANSWER
A.
EFFECT OF TIME ON WORKABILITY :
1.
FRESHLY MIXED CONCRETE STIFFENS WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME. THIS IS DIFFERENT
FROM THE HARDENING OF THE MIX.
2.
AS TIME PASSES, WATER IS LOST DUE TO ABSORPTION BY AGGREGATES IF THEY ARE
NOT ALREADY SATURATED. SOME WATER IS LOST DUE TO EVAPORATION, ESPECIALLY
IF THE CONCRETE IS EXPOSED TO HOT WEATHER AND WIND THEN WORKABILITY
DECREASE.
B.
EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON WORKABILITY :
1.
WHEN TEMPERATURE INCREASES, THEN IN THE SAME PROPORTION WORKABILITY
OF FRESH CONCRETE DECREASES.
2.
THE REASON THAT STANDS BEHIND IS "WHEN TEMPERATURE INCREASES THEN
EVAPORATION RATE ALSO INCREASES DUE TO THAT HYDRATION RATE DECREASES AND
HENCE, CONCRETE WILL GAIN STRENGTH EARLIER".
3.
DUE TO FAST HYDRATION OF CONCRETE, A HARDENING COMES IN CONCRETE AND
THAT DECREASES THE WORKABILITY OF FRESH CONCRETE.

SEGREGATION : IT IS DEFINED AS THE SEPARATING OUT OF INGREDIENTS OF
CONCRETE MIX SO THAT THE MIX IS NO LONGER IN A HOMOGENEOUS CONDITION.
BLEEDING : BLEEDING AS CONCRETE IS SAID TO OCCUR WHEN UNREACTED WATER
IN THE MIX TENDS TO RISE TO THE SURFACE OF FRESHLY PLACED CONCRETE DUE TO
SEDIMENTATION OF CONSTITUENTS OF CONCRETE.
CURING : THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE LOSS OF WATER FROM CONCRETE IS
PREVENTED IS KNOWN AS CURING

QUE 4.9.
WRITE ABOUT SEGREGATION AND ITS CAUSES. HOW REDUCE
SEGREGATION OF CONCRETE ?
ANSWER
A.
SEGREGATION : IT IS DEFINED AS THE SEPARATION OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF A
HOMOGENEOUS MIXTURE OF CONCRETE. IT IS CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN
SIZES AND WEIGHTS OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES.
B. CAUSES OF SEGREGATION IN CONCRETE :
1.
TRANSPORTING CONCRETE MIXES FOR LONG DISTANCES.
2.
POORLY PROPORTIONED MIX, WHERE SUFFICIENT MATRIX IS NOT THERE TO BIND THE
AGGREGATES.
3.
DROPPING CONCRETE FROM MORE THAN 1M.
4.
VIBRATING CONCRETE FOR A LONG TIME.
C.
REMEDIAL MEASURES :
I.
TO REDUCE SEGREGATION, WELL GRADED AGGREGATES ARE USED AND CONCRETE IS

DISCUSS THE FACTORS AFFECTING BLEEDING OF CONCRETE.


4-11 D ()
ANSWER
FACTORS AFFECTING BLEEDING OF CONCRETE : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS
THAT AFFECTING THE BLEEDING OF CONCRETE :
1.
WATER CONTENT AND WATER CEMENT RATIO :
I.
ANY INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF WATER OR WATER-TO-CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL
RATIO RESULTS IN MORE AVAILABLE WATER FOR BLEEDING.
II.
A ONE-FIFTH INCREASE IN WATER CONTENT OF A NORMAL CONCRETE MIXTURE CAN
INCREASE BLEEDING RATE MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES.
2.
CEMENT :
I.
THE TYPE, CONTENT AND FINENESS OF CEMENT CAN EFFECT BLEEDING. AS THE
FINENESS OF THE CEMENT INCREASES, THE AMOUNT OF BLEEDING DECREASES.
II.
INCREASES IN CEMENT CONTENT, REDUCES THE WATER-CEMENT RATIO, AND ALSO
REDUCES BLEEDING.
3.
SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTING MATERIALS :
I:
FLY ASH, SLAG. SILICA FUME, RICE HUSK ASH AND NATURAL POZZOLANAS CAN
REDUCE BLEEDING BY THEIR INHERENT PROPERTIES AND BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT
OF CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS IN A MIXTURE.
4. AGGREGATE :
I.
AGGREGATE THAT CONTAIN A HIGH AMOUNT OF SILT, CLAY OR OTHER MATERIAL
PASSING THE75 UM SIEVE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN REDUCING BLEEDING.
5.
CHEMICAL ADMIXTURE :
I.
AIR-ENTRAINING AGENTS HAVE BEEN USED LARGELY BECAUSE THE AIR BUBBLES
APPEAR TO KEEP THE SOLID PARTICLES IN SUSPENSION.
II.
WATER REDUCERS ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF BLEEDING BECAUSE THEY RELEASE
TRAPPED WATER IN MIXTURE.
QUE 4.11.
HOW WOULD YOU REDUCE BLEEDING FROM CONCRETE ?
ANSWER
CONTROLLING MEASURES OF BLEEDING : FOLLOWING ARE THE CONTROLLING
MEASURES OF BLEEDING FROM CONCRETE :
1.
PROPER PROPORTIONING OF CONCRETE.
2.
A COMPLETE AND UNIFORM MIXING OF CONCRETE.
3.
IF WE CAN INCREASE THE TRAVELING LENGTH OF WATER TO BE BLEEDED, THE
BLEEDING CAN BE REDUCED CONSIDERABLY. FOR THIS PURPOSE WE CAN USE
FINELY DIVIDED POZZOLANIC MATERIALS
4.
AN INTRODUCTION OF AIR-ENTRAINMENT BY USING AIR ENTRAINING AGENT CAN
REDUCE BLEEDING.
5.
THE USE OF FINER CEMENT.
6.
BY USING OF A RICH MIX RATHER THAN LEAN MIX.

WHAT ARE THE EFFERTE OF BLEEDING ON CONCRETE PROPERTIES
ANSWER
FOLLEWING ARE THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING EN CONCRETE PROPERTIES:
1
DUE IN BINEDING ENNERETE LESES ITS HOMOGENEITY.
=
BLEEDING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING PERMEABILITY IN CONCRETE.
3
THIS ACCUMULATION OF WATER CREATES E WATER VOIDS AND REDUCES BOND
BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE AND CEMENT PAST. SO THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
REDURES
4
WATER THAT ACCUMULATES BELOW THE REINFORCING BARS. PARTICULARLY BELOW
THE CRANKED BARS. REDUCES THE BOND BETWEEN THE REINFORCEMENT AND
CONCRETE
3
THE BIEEDING WATER FLEWS AT OVER THE UNSUPPORTED SIDE OF PAVEMENT
WHICH CAUSS COLLAPSING OF =IDES
6.
IN PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION BLEEDING WATER DELAYS SURFACE FINISHING AND
APPLICATION OF CURING COMPOUND
7. BIEEDING CAUSES OF "LAITANCE IN CONCRETE' DUE TO THE FORMATION OF
LARTANO, STRUCTURES MAN LOSE ITS WEARING CAPACITY AND DECREASES ITS LIFE.
8
WATER WHILE MOVING FROM BOTTOM TO THE TOP. FORMS CONTINUOUS CHANNELS.
DAR TO THIS CHANNEL. CONCRETE BECOMES PERMEABLE AND ALLOW WATER TO
MOVE. WHICH FORMS WATER VOIDS IN THE MATRIX AND REDUCES THE BOND
BETWEEN AGGREGATE AND THE CEMENT PASTE.

THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CURING.
ANSWER
A. CURING : I: AS A PROCEDURE THAT AS ADOPTED TO PROMOTE THE HARDENING OF
CONCRETE UNDER CONDITIONS OF HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE WHICH ARE
CONDUAIVE TO THE PROGRESSIVE AND PROPER SETTING OF THE CONSTITUENT
CETMENT
B.
IMPORTANCE OF CURING : FOLLOWING ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF EURING OF
CONCRETE
1. TO MAINTAIN MOUSTURE CONTENT IN THE MIX FOR COMPLETE HYDRATION OF
CONCRETE
2
TO MAINTAIN UNIFORM TEMPERATURE OF THE CONCRETE.
2
TO PRESERVE THAT PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE, SUCH AS IMPERMEABILITY, DURABILITY
AND STRENGTH
4
TO REDUCE THE SHRINKAGE OF THE CONCRETE.
C. METHODE OF CURING OF CONCRETE: FOLLOWING ARE THE METHODS OF CURING :

COMERETE TECHNOLOGY
PONDING OF WATER OVER THE CONCRETE SURFACE AFTER IT HAS SET :
1.
THIS IS THE MOST COMMON METHOD OFEURING THE ENNERETE ALAB IFF PAVEMENTS
AND
CONSISTS OF STERING THE WATER TN A DEPTH OF 50 MM ON THE SURFACE BY
CONSTRUCTING SMALL PUDDLE CLAY BUNDS ALL AROUND
CORERING THE CONCRETE WITH WET STRAW OR DAMP EARTH : IN THIS
2
METHED THE DAMP EARTH OR SAND IN LAYERS OF 50 MM HEIGHT ARE SPREAD
OVER THE SURFACE OF CONCRETE PAVEMENTS. THE MATERIAL IS KEPT MOIST BY
PERIODICAL SPRINKLING OF WATER.
COVERING THE CONCRETE WITH WET BURLAP : THE CONCRETE IS COVERED
S
WITH BURLAP (COARSE JUTE OR HEMP) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER PLACING. AND
THE MATERIAL IS KEPT CONTINUOUSLY MOIST FOR THE CURING PERIOD.
4.
SPRINKLING OF WATER :
THIS IS A USEFUL METHOD FOR CURING VERTICAL OR INCLINED SURFACES OF CONCRETE.
I
THE SPRAYING CAN BE DONE IN FINE STREAMS THROUGH NOZZLES FIXED TO A PIPE
II.
SPARED AT SET INTERVALS.
II
FLOGGING IS DONE IN THE SAME WAY EXCEPT THAT THE FLOGGING NOZZLES PRODUCE
A MIST-LIKE EFFECT. WHEREAS SPRAYING NOZZLES SHED OUT FINE SPRAY.
COVERING THE SURFACE WITH WATERPROOF PAPER
:
5.
I.
WATERPROOF PAPER PREVENTS LOSS OF WATER IN CONCRETE AND PROTECTS THE
SURFACE FROM DAMAGE.
IL
A GOOD QUALITY PAPER CAN BE OFTEN REUSED. THE PAPER IS USUALLY MADE OF
TWO SHEETS STRUCK TOGETHER BY RUBBER LATEX COMPOSITION.
6.
LEAVING THE SHUTTERING OR FORMWORK : THE THICK WATERTIGHT
FORMWORK ALSO PREVENTS THE LOSS OF MOISTURE IN CONCRETE AND HELPS IN
CURING THE SIDES AND THE BASE OF THE CONCRETE.
7.
MEMBRANE CURING OF THE CONCRETE :
I.
THE PROCESS OF APPLYING A MEMBRANE FORMING COMPOUND ON CONCRETE
SURFACE IS TERMED MEMBRANE CURING.
II
OFTEN, THE TERM MEMBRANE IS USED NOT ONLY TO REFER TO LIQUID MEMBRANES
BUT ALSO TO A SOLID SHEETING USED TO COVER THE CONCRETE SURFACE.
IIL.
THE CURING MEMBRANE SERVES AS A PHYSICAL BARRIER TO PREVENT LOSS OF
MOISTURE FROM THE CONCRETE TO BE CURED.
IV. A CURING LIQUID MEMBRANE SHOULD DRY WITHIN 3 TO 4 HOURS TO FORM A
CONTINUOUS COHERENT ADHESIVE FILM FREE FROM PINHOLES AND HAVE NO
DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON CONCRETE.
8.
CHEMICAL CURING :
I.
CHEMICAL CURING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SPRAYING THE SODIUM SILICATE (WATER
GLASS) SOLUTION ON CONCRETE SURFACE.
N
ABOUT 500 K OF SODIUM SILICATE MIXED WITH WATER CAN COVER 1 M� OF
SURFACE AND FROM A HARD AND INSOLUBLE CALCIUM SILICATE FILM.
UI,
IT ACTUALLY ACTS AS A CASE HARDENER AND CURING AGENT.

1.
CONCRETE MIX PROPORTION :
I.
CREEP INCREASES WITH INCREASE IN WATER/CEMENT RATIO.
II.
A POORER PASTE STRUCTURE UNDERGOES HIGHER CREEP.
III.
THE AMOUNT OF PASTE CONTENT AND ITS QUALITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
FACTORS INFLUENCING CREEP.
IV. CREEP IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE.
2.
AGGREGATE PROPERTIES :
I
LIGHT WEIGHT AGGREGATE SHOWS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER CREEP THAN NORMAL
WEIGHT AGGREGATE.


4-25 D ()
THE HIGHER THE MODULUS OF ELASTICITY THE LESS IS THE CREEP.
II.
III.
AGGREGATES INFLUENCE CREEP OF CONCRETE THROUGH A RESTRAINING EFFECT ON
THE MAGNITUDE OF CREEP.
3.
AGE NT LOADING :
I.
AGE AT WHICH A CONCRETE MEMBER IS LOADED WILL HAVE A PREDOMINANT
EFFECT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF CREEP.
II.
THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE CONCRETE BEING DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT AGE
ALSO INFLUENCES THE MAGNITUDE OF CREEP.

CURING CONDITION : LARGER THE CURING SMALLER THE CREEP.
5.
CEMENT PROPERTIES :
I.
THE TYPE OF CEMENT EFFECTS CREEP IN SO FAR AS IT INFLUENCES THE STRENGTH OF
THE CONCRETE AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION OF LOAD.
II.
FINENESS OF CEMENT AFFECTS THE STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT AT EARLY AGES AND
THUS INFLUENCES CREEP.
II.
THE FINER THE CEMENT THE HIGHER ITS GYPSUM REQUIREMENT SO THAT RE
GRINDING OF CEMENT IN LABORATORY WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF GYPSUM PRODUCES
AN IMPROPERLY RETARDED CEMENT, WHICH EXHIBITS HIGH CREEP.
6
TEMPERATURE :
I.
THE RATE OF CREEP INCREASES WITH TEMPERATURE UP TO ABOUT 70 �C WHEN,
FOR A 1:7 MIX AND 0.6 W/C RATIO. IT IS APPROXIMATELY 3.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN
AT 21�C.
II.
BETWEEN 70 �C AND 96 �C IT DROPS OFF TO 1.7 TIMES THAN AT 21 �C.
III. AS FAR AS LOW TEMPERATURE IS CONCERNED, FREEZING PRODUCES A HIGHER
INITIAL RATE OF CREEP BUT IT QUICKLY DROPS TO ZERO.
IV. AT TEMPERATURE BETWEEN 10 �C AND 30 �C, CREEP IS ABOUT ONE HALF OF
CREEP AT 21 �C.
7.
STRESS LEVEL :
I.
HIGHER THE STRESS HIGHER WILL BE THE CREEP.

REDUCE THE INTERNAL STRESSES DUE TO NON-UNIFORM LOAD OR RESTRAINED
SHRINKAGE.
5.
IN MASS CONCRETE STRUCTURES SUCH AS DAMS, ON ACCOUNT OF DIFFERENTIAL
TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS AT THE INTERIOR AND SURFACE, CREEP IS HARMFUL AND
BY ITSELF MAY BE A CAUSE OF CRACKING IN THE INTERIOR OF DAMS.

EXPLAIN HOW CREEP IS MEASURED ?
ANSWER
CALCULATING CREEP OF CONCRETE :
1.
THE CREEP STRAIN-STRESS RELATION IN CONCRETE IS COMMONLY TAKEN TO BE
�,= $0
WHERE IS CALLED THE SPECIFIC CREEP.

QUE 4.29.
WHAT IS SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE ? EXPLAIN ABOUT
CLASSIFICATION OF SHRINKAGE.
ANSWER
A. SHRINKAGE :
1. SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE IS THE TIME-DEPENDENT STRAIN MEASURED IN AN
UNLOADED AND UNRESTRAINED SPECIMEN AT CONSTANT TEMPERATURE.
2.
SHRINKAGE IS SHORTENING OF CONCRETE DUE TO DRYING AND IS INDEPENDENT OF
APPLIED LOADS.
B. TYPES OF SHRINKAGE : FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SHRINKAGE :
1.
PLASTIC SHRINKAGE :
I.
PLASTIC SHRINKAGE OCCURS VERY SOON AFTER POURING THE CONCRETE IN THE
FORMS.


4-27 D ()
II.
THE HYDRATION OF CEMENT RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF CONCRETE
DUE TO EVAPORATION FROM THE SURFACE OF CONCRETE, WHICH LEADS TO CRACKING.
2
DRYING SHRINKAGE :
I
THE SHRINKAGE THAT APPEARS AFTER THE SETTING AND HARDENING OF THE
CONCRETE MIXTURE DUE TO LOSS OF CAPILLARY WATER IS KNOWN AS DRYING
SHRINKAGE.
II.
DRYING SHRINKAGE GENERALLY OCCURS IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS AND DECREASES
WITH TIME.
3.
CARBONATION SHRINKAGE :
I
CARBONATION SHRINKAGE OCCURS DUE TO THE REACTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE
(CO2, WITH THE HYDRATED CEMENT MINERALS, CARBONATING CA(OH)2 TO
CACO2.
�.
THE CARBONATION SLOWLY PENETRATES THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE CONCRETE.
III.
THIS TYPE OF SHRINKAGE MAINLY OCCURS AT MEDIUM HUMIDITY AND RESULTS
INCREASED STRENGTH AND REDUCED PERMEABILITY.
4. AUTOGENOUS SHRINKAGE :

QUE 4.30.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECTING OF SHRINKAGE.
ANSWER
AFFECTING FACTORS OF SHRINKAGE :
1.
DRYING CONDITIONS :
I.
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE DRYING CONDITION OR THE HUMIDITY IN THE
ATMOSPHERE.
II.
NO SHRINKAGE WILL OCCUR IF THE CONCRETE IS PLACED IN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
RELATIVE HUMIDITY.
2 TIME :
I.
THE SHRINKAGE RATE WILL DECREASE RAPIDLY WITH TIME.
�.
IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT 14 TO 34 % OF THE 20 YEAR SHRINKAGE WILL
OCCUR WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF IT BEING POURED.
III.
WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE CONCRETE BEING POURED, SHRINKAGE WILL BE ABOUT
66 TO 85 % OF THE 20 YEAR SHRINKAGE.
3.
WATER CEMENT RATIO :
I.
THE WATER TO CEMENT RATIO WILL INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF SHRINKAGE THAT
OCCURS.
II.
THE CONCRETE'S RICHNESS ALSO AFFECTS THE SHRINKAGE.
III. THE PROCESS OF SWELLING AND THEN DRYING AFFECTS THE CONCRETE'S INTEGRITY
AND THE SHRINKAGE.

WHAT ARE THE EFFECT OF SHRINKAGE ON CONCRETE AND HOW IS
IT REDUCES ?
ANSWER
EFFECTS OF SHRINKAGE : FOLLOWING ARE THE EFFECTS OF SHRINKAGE ON CONCRETE:
1.
SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE BETWEEN MOVEMENT JOINTS CAUSES JOINTS TO OPEN
OR MAKES IT WIDER. THEREFORE JOINTS MUST BE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE
THE WIDENING CAUSED BY SHRINKAGE.
2
WHERE OTHER MATERIALS, SUCH AS CERAMIC TILES, ARE FIXED ON TOP OF CONCRETE
SURFACE, SHRINKAGE OF THE CONCRETE CAUSES RELATIVE MOVEMENT BETWEEN
THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS. THE RESULTING STRESSES CAN CAUSE FAILURE AT THE
INTERFACE.
3.
IF SHRINKAGE IS RESTRAINED, THE CONCRETE IS PUT INTO TENSION AND WHEN
TENSILE STRESS BECOMES EQUAL TO TENSILE STRENGTH, THE CONCRETE CRACKS.
4.
SHRINKAGE OF THE CONCRETE CAUSES THE CONCRETE TO GRIP REINFORCING BARS
MORE TIGHTLY. THIS INCREASES FRICTION BETWEEN CONCRETE AND STEEL AND SO
IMPROVES BOND STRENGTH, ESPECIALLY FOR PLAIN BARS
5.
THE DEFLECTION OF FLEXURAL MEMBERS IS INCREASED BY SHRINKAGE. THIS
IS
BECAUSE THE LIGHTLY REINFORCED COMPRESSION ZONE IS FREE TO SHRINK MORE
THAN HEAVILY REINFORCED TENSION ZONE.
6.
SHRINKAGE CAUSES A REDUCTION IN PRE STRESSING FORCE.
PREVENTION OF SHRINKAGE : FOLLOWING ARE THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO
REDUCED SHRINKAGE :
1.
PROVIDE SUN SHADES IN CASE OF SLAB CONSTRUCTION TO CONTROL THE SURFACE
TEMPERATURE.
2.
DAMPEN THE SUBGRADE OF CONCRETE BEFORE PLACEMENT IT IS LIABLE TO WATER
ABSORPTION BUT SHOULD NOT OVER DAMP.
3.
TRY TO START THE CURING SOON AFTER FINISHING.

RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE :
1.
RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE IS SIMPLY THE OLD AGGREGATE CONCRETE THAT
HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM BUILDINGS FOUNDATIONS PAVEMENTS AND OTHERS
-
STRUCTURES, AND CRUSHED TO THE SPECIFIED SIZE.
2.
THE REUSE OF BROKEN CONCRETE PIECES AS COARSE AGGREGATE IS A PROVEN
TECHNOLOGY. OLD CONCRETE CAN BE CRUSHED AND USED IN FRESH CONCRETE AS
PARTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR CONVENTIONAL NATURAL AGGREGATES.
3.
THE OLD CONCRETE CAN BE FROM DEMOLITION WASTE (RECYCLED CONCRETE
AGGREGATE) OR LEFTOVER CONCRETE AT ACONSTRUCTION SITE (LEFTOVER CONCRETE
AGGREGATE).
4.
THE FRESH CONCRETE LEFTOVER AT A SITE CAN ALSO B� WASHED FREE OF CEMENT
PASTE AND THE AGGREGATES RECOVERED TO BE USED SUBSEQUENTLY (RECOVERED
CONCRETE AGGREGATE).

B. DESCRIBE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PLASTICIZERS WITH NEAT
SKETCH. MENTION ANY THREE SUPER PLASTICIZERS.
ANS
A. MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PLASTICIZERS : THE ACTION OF PLASTICIZERS
IS MAINLY TO FLUIDIFY THE MIX AND IMPROVE THE WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE,
MORTAR OR GROUT. THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED ARE :
1. DISPERSION :
I PORTLAND CEMENT BEING IN FINE STATE WILL HAVE A TENDENCY TO FLOCCULATE
IN WET CONCRETE, THESE FLOCCULATION ENTRAPS CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER
USED IN THE MIX.
II.
WHEN PLASTICIZERS ARE USED, THEY GET ADSORBED ON THE CEMENT
PARTICLES, CREATES PARTICLE TO PARTICLE REPULSIVE FORCES WHICH OVERCOME
THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES.
NI. THIS REPULSIVE FORCE IS CALLED ZETA POTENTIAL, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE
BASE, SOLID CONTENT, QUANTITY OF PLASTICIZER USED.
IV. WHEN CEMENT PARTICLES ARE DEFLOCCULATED, THE WATER TRAPPED INSIDE
THE FLOCS GETS RELEASED AND IS NOW AVAILABLE TO FLUIDIFY THE MIX.
2.
LUBRICATING: THE AGENTS ARE ORGANIC BY NATURE, THUS THEY LUBRICATE
THE MIX REDUCING THE FRICTION AND INCREASING THE WORKABILITY.
3. RETARDING EFFECT :
I. PLASTICIZERS GET ADSORBED ON THE SURFACE OF THE CEMENT PARTICLES AND
FORM A THIN SHEATH.
II. THIS SHEATH INHIBITS THE SURFACE HYDRATION REACTION BETWEEN WATER
AND CEMENT AS LONG AS-SUFFICIENT PLASTICIZERS MOLECULES ARE AVAILABLE.
III. QUANTITY OF PLASTICIZERS WILL DECREASE AS THE POLYMERS BECOME
ENTRAPPED IN HYDRATION PRODUCTS.
THE FOLLOWING MECHANISMS MAY TAKE PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY :
A. REDUCTION IN THE SURFACE TENSION OF WATER.
B. INDUCED ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION BETWEEN PARTICLES OF CEMENT.
C. LUBRICATING FILM BETWEEN CEMENT PARTICLES.
D. DISPERSION OF CEMENT GRAINS, RELEASING WATER TRAPPED WITHIN CEMENT
FLOCS.
E. INHIBITION OF THE SURFACE HYDRATION REACTION OF THE HYDRATION CEMENT
PARTICLES, LEAVING MORE WATER TO FLUIDIFY THE MIX.

I. IT ACTS AS LUBRICANT FOR THE FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATE AND MAKES THE
MIXTURE WORKABLE.
II. IT ACTS CHEMICALLY WITH CEMENT TO FORM THE BINDING PASTE.
III. IT IS EMPLOYED TO DAMP THE AGGREGATE SURFACE IN ORDER TO PREVENT
THEM FROM ABSORBING WATER VITALLY NECESSARY FOR CHEMICAL ACTION.
IV. IT FACILITATES THE SPREADING OF AGGREGATE.
V. IT HELPS TO FLUX THE CEMENTING MATERIAL OVER THE SURFACE OF THE
AGGREGATE.
VI. IT ENABLES THE CONCRETE MIX TO FLOW INTO MOULDS.
4. ATTEMPT ANY ONE PART OF THE FOLLOWING :
(7 X 1 = 7)
A. DESCRIBE GAS FORMING AGENTS ? GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A MATERIAL
IN POWDER FORM USED AS A GAS FORMING AGENT.
ANS. GAS FORMING AGENT :
1. THESE ADMIXTURES WHEN ADDED TO MORTAR OR CONCRETE MIXTURE REACT
CHEMICALLY WITH HYDROXIDES PRESENT IN THE CEMENT AND FORM MINUTE
BUBBLES OF HYDROGENGAS OF SIZE RANGING FROM 0.1 TO 1 MM THROUGHOUT
THE CEMENT-WATER MATRIX.
2. THIS ACTION, WHEN PROPERLY CONTROLLED, CAUSES A SLIGHT EXPANSION IN
PLASTIC CONCRETE OR MORTAR AND THUS REDUCES OR ELIMINATES VOIDS
CAUSED BY NORMAL SETTLEMENT THAT OCCUR DURING THE PLACEMENT OF
CONCRETE.
3. WATER FILMS AROUND THE GAS BUBBLES PREVENT BLEEDING.
4. THE GAS IS BENEFICIAL IN IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUT FOR
FILLING JOINTS, IN IMPROVING THE HOMOGENEITY OF GROUTED CONCRETE,
AND IN FILLING BLOCK OUTS AND OPENINGS IN CONCRETE STRUCTURES.
5. LARGER AMOUNTS OF POWDER INCREASE THE EXPANSION APPRECIABLY
RESULTING IN A GAS-FILLED LIGHTWEIGHT LOW STRENGTH CONCRETE. THESE
ARE ALSO CALLED FOAMED CONCRETE OR AERATED CONCRETE OR CELLULAR
CONCRETE.
EXAMPLE : ALUMINIUM POWDER, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, ACTIVATED
CARBON, ETC.
B. WRITE A NOTE ON WORKABILITY AGENTS. GIVE EXAMPLES.
ANS. WORKABILITY AGENTS :
1. THE WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE IS GOVERNED BY THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE
IN THE MIX. WHERE REDUCTION OF AGGREGATE (OR INCREASE IN CEMENT) IS
IMPRACTICAL, WORKABILITY IS INCREASED BY ADDING A PLASTICIZER.
2. AIR-ENTRAINING AGENTS, WHEN USED, ARE PLASTICIZERS. OTHER SUBSTANCES
INCLUDE CALCIUM CHLORIDE, LIME, FLY ASH, AND OTHER POZZOLANS.
3. LIME INCREASES THE CEMENTING PROPERTIES OF CEMENT, AS DO POZZOLANS
COMBINED WITH LIME.
4. FLY ASH IS INEXPENSIVE COMPARED TO CEMENT AND IS USED AS A PARTIAL
REPLACEMENT (UP TO AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT) OF THE CEMENT.
5. IT CHANGES BOTH THE PLASTIC AND THE HARDENED PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE.
6. FLY ASH IMPROVES WORKABILITY AND REDUCES SEGREGATION, BLEEDING,
AND THE HEAT OF HYDRATION.

N. EXPLAIN HOW YOU WOULD DETERMINE THE VARIOUS ELASTIC
MODULI FOR CONCRETE.
ANE REFER Q. 4.24 AND Q. 4.25, PAGE 4-23D; UNIT-4.
B. WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY CARBONATION OF CONCRETE ? HOW
IS IT TESTED ?
ANS
1. CARBONATION OCCURS IN CONCRETE BECAUSE THE CALCIUM BEARING PHASES
PRESENT ARE ATTACKED BY CARBON DIOXIDE OF THE AIR AND CONVERTED TO
CALCIUM CARBONATE.
2. CEMENT PASTE CONTAINS 25-50 % CALCIUM HYDROXIDE (CA(OH)2) BY
WEIGHT, WHICH MEAN THAT THE PH OF THE FRESH CEMENT PASTE IS AT
LEAST 12.5.
3. THE PH OF A FULLY CARBONATED PASTE IS ABOUT 7.
4. THE CONCRETE WILL CARBONATE IF CO2 FROM AIR OR FROM WATER ENTERS
THE CONCRETE ACCORDING TO:
CALOH)2 + CO2
CACO3 + H2O
5. WHEN CA(OH)2 IS REMOVED FROM THE PASTE HYDRATED CSH WILL LIBERATE
CAO WHICH WILL ALSO CARBONATE.
6. THE RATE OF CARBONATION DEPENDS ON POROSITY AND MOISTURE CONTENT
OF THE CONCRETE.
7.
THE CARBONATION PROCESS REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF WATER BECAUSE
CO2 DISSOLVES IN WATER FORMING H2CO3.
8. IF THE CONCRETE IS TOO DRY (RH < 40%)CO2 CANNOT DISSOLVE AND NO
CARBONATION OCCURS.
9. IF ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS TOO WET (RH > 90%) CO2 CANNOT ENTER THE
CONCRETE AND THE CONCRETE WILL NOT CARBONATE. OPTIMAL CONDITIONS
FOR CARBONATION OCCUR AT A RH OF 50% (RANGE 40-90%).
TEST OF CARBONATION OF CONCRETE
:
1. CARBONATION MAY BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIELD BY THE PRESENCE OF A
DISCOLOURED ZONE IN THE SURFACE OF THE CONCRETE.
2. THE COLOUR MAY VARY FROM LIGHT GRAY AND DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE TO
STRONG ORANGE AND EASY TO RECOGNIZE.
3.
CARBONATION CAN BE VISUALIZED BY USING PHENOLPHTHALEIN.
4. IN THE OPTICAL MICROSCOPE CARBONATION IS RECOGNIZED BY THE PRESENCE
OF CALCITE CRYSTALS AND THE ABSENCE OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE, ETTRINGITE
AND UN-HYDRATED CEMENT GRAINS.

6. ATTEMPT ANY ONE PART OF THE FOLLOWING
:
(7 X 1 = 7)
N. WRITE A BRIEF NOTE ON FLEXURE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE.
ANC FLEXURE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE :
1. THE DETERMINATION OF FLEXURAL TENSILE STRENGTH IS ESSENTIAL TO ESTIMATE
THE LOAD AT WHICH THE CONCRETE MEMBERS MAY CRACK.
2. AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE BY
CONDUCTING A DIRECT TENSION TEST, IT IS COMPUTED BY FLEXURE TESTING.
3. THE FLEXURAL TENSILE STRENGTH AT FAILURE OR THE MODULUS OF RUPTURE IS
THUS DETERMINED AND USED WHEN NECESSARY.
4. ITS KNOWLEDGE IS USEFUL IN THE DESIGN OF PAVEMENT SLABS AND AIRFIELD
RUNWAY AS FLEXURAL TENSION IS CRITICAL IN THESE CASES.
5. THE MODULUS OF RUPTURE IS DETERMINE. BY TESTING STANDARD TEST
SPECIMENS OF 150 MM X 150 MM X 700 MM OVER A SPAN OF 600 MM
OR 100 MM X 100 MM X 500 MM OVER A SPAN OF 400 MM, UNDER
SYMMETRICAL TWO-POINT LOADING.
6. THE MODULUS OF RUPTURE IS DETERMINED FROM THE MOMENT AT FAILURES
ASF,=MIZ.
B. DISCUSS THE INFLUENCE OF MIX PROPORTIONS OF CONCRETE ON
SHRINKAGE.
ANC. FOLLOWING ARE THE AFFECTING FACTORS OF SHRINKAGE :
1. TYPE OF COARSE AGGREGATES : IN GENERAL, CONCRETES MADE WITH
HIGH MODULI OF ELASTICITY NON-SHRINKING AGGREGATES WILL HAVE LOW
SHRINKAGE.
2 SHAPE OF AGGREGATES : THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF COARSE AGGREGATE
INFLUENCE THE LOSS OF MOISTURE AND IT HAS THEREFORE AN INDIRECT EFFECT
ON THE SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE. IN GENERAL, THE SMALLER THE AGGREGATE
SIZE, THE MORE SURFACE AREA. MORE WATER IS ABSORBED AS A RESULT AND,
THEREFORE, MORE SHRINKAGE.
3. HARDNESS OF AGGREGATES : HARDER AGGREGATE WITH HIGHER MODULUS
OF ELASTICITY LIKE QUARTZ SHRINKS MUCH LESS THAN SOFTER AGGREGATES
SUCH AS SANDSTONE.
4. EFFECT OF ADMIXTURES : ADDITION OF CALCIUM CHLORIDE INCREASES THE
SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE GENERALLY BETWEEN 10 TO 50 % THE PLASTICIZERS
WHICH RED.ICE THE WATER-CEMENT RATIO OF THE CONCRETE, THEIR NET
EFFECT ON SHRINKAGE IS NEGLIGIBLE.
5. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF CEMENT : THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
OF CEMENT HAS BEEN OBSERVED AS NOT HAVING ANY EFFECT ON THE
SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE. HOWEVER CEMENT DEFICIENT IN GYPSUM EXHIBITS
A GREATLY INCREASED SHRINKAGE.
6. EFFECT OF HIGH ALUMINA CEMENT : THE SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE
MADE WITH HIGH ALUMINA CEMENT IS OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THAT

CROCRELE TECHNOLOGY
SP-11D ()
OF CONCRETE MADE WITH PORTLAND CEMENT, BUT IN CASE OF HIGH ALUMINA
CEMENT SHRINKAGE TAKES PLACE MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN WHEN
PORTLAND CEMENT IS USED.
7. WATER CONTENT : THE WATER CONTENT AFFECTS THE WATER-CEMENT
RATIO HENCE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF WATER, GREATER THE SHRINKAGE AS
HIGHER THE WATER-CEMENT RATIO.
&. PROPERTIES OF CEMENT : THE PROPERTIES OF CEMENT HAVE LITTLE EFFECT
ON THE SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE. FINENESS OF CEMENT HAS NO INFLUENCE
ON THE SHRINKAGE OF CONCRETE. HOWEVER IT INCREASES THE SHRINKAGE
OF CEMENT PASTE.
9. QUALITY OF CEMENT PASTE : THE QUALITY OF CEMENT PASTE INFLUENCES
THE MAGNITUDE OF SHRINKAGE. THE QUALITY OF CEMENT PATE IS DEPENDENT
ON THE WATER CEMENT RATIO. HIGHER THE W/C RATIO, GREATER THE
SHRINKAGE,
7. ATTEMPT ANY ONE PART OF THE FOLLOWING :

ANS. REFER Q. 5.8, PAGE 5-9D, UNIT-5.
B. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE AND HIGH
DENSITY CONCRETE.
ANS. HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE :
1. HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE IS A CONCRETE MIXTURE, WHICH POSSESS
HIGH DURABILITY AND HIGH STRENGTH WHEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL
CONCRETE.
2. THIS CONCRETE CONTAINS ONE OR MORE OF CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS SUCH
AS FLY ASH, SILICA FUME OR GROUND GRANULATED BLAST FURNACE SLAG AND
USUALLY A SUPER PLASTICIZER.
3. HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE HAS HIGH STRENGTH AND LOW PERMEABILITY.
4. HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE IS NOT A SPECIAL TYPE OF CONCRETE. IT
COMPRISES OF THE SAME MATERIALS AS THAT OF THE CONVENTIONAL CEMENT
CONCRETE.
5. THE USE OF SOME MINERAL AND CHEMICAL ADMIXTURES LIKE SILICA FUME
AND SUPER PLASTICIZER ENHANCE THE STRENGTH, DURABILITY AND
WORKABILITY QUALITIES TO A VERY HIGH EXTENT.
6. IT IS USED IN HIGH RISE BUILDING COLUMN, OFF SHORE PLATFORMS AND
HEAVY-DUTY FLOORS.
HIGH DENSITY CONCRETE :
1. CONCRETE HAVING UNIT WEIGHT OF 30 KN/M� TO 64 KN/M� IS CALLED HIGH
DENSITY OR HEAVY WEIGHT CONCRETE.

SP-12D()

ANS REFER Q. 3.4. PAGE 3-4D, UNIT-3.
D. WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO ADD GYPSUM IN THE MANUFACTURING OF
CEMENT ?
ANS. ROLE OF GYPSUM IN CEMENT :
1. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ADDING GYPSUM IN THE CEMENT IS TO SLOW DOWN
THE HYDRATION PROCESS OF CEMENT ONCE IT IS MIXED WITH WATER.
2.
THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN HYDRATION OF CEMENT IS THAT, WHEN THE
WATER IS ADDED INTO CEMENT, IT STARTS REACTING WITH THE C.A AND
HARDENS. THE TIME TAKEN IN THIS PROCESS IS VERY LESS, WHICH DOES NOT
ALLOW TIME FOR TRANSPORTING, MIXING AND PLACING.
3. WHEN GYPSUM IS ADDED INTO THE CEMENT AND WATER IS ADDED TO IT,
REACTION WITH C.A.A PARTICLES TAKES PLACE TO FORM ETTRINGITE.
4. THIS ETTRINGITE IS INITIALLY FORMED AS VERY FINE-GRAINED CRYSTALS, WHICH
FORM A COATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE C3A PARTICLES THESE CRYSTALS
ARE TOO SMALL TO BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE PARTICLES OF CEMENT.
THE CEMENT MIX THEREFORE REMAINS PLASTIC AND WORKABLE.

5. THE TIME ALLOWED FOR MIXING, TRANSPORTING AND PLACING PLAYS AN
IMPORTANT ROLE IN STRENGTH, COMPOSITION AND WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE.
AS GYPSUM RETARDS THE PROCESS OF HYDRATION, IT IS TERMED AS RETARDING
AGENT OF CEMENT.
E WRITE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF READY MIX CONCRETE PLACEMENT
METHODS.
ANS. READY MIX CONCRETE PLACEMENT METHODS INCLUDE FOLLOWING BASIC
PRINCIPLES :
1. WHEN ARRIVING TO THE SITE, THE CONCRETE TRANSPORT CERTIFICATE MUST
BE CHECKED FOR DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF ORDERED CONCRETE (QUANTITY,
CLASS, MAXIMUM AGGREGATE SIZE, SLUMP, TEMPERATURE, TYPE OF CEMENT
ETC.) AND TIME DURATION OF TRANSPORT.
2. CONCRETE SHALL BE DELIVERED TO THE SITE AND DISCHARGED FROM THE
TRUCK COMPLETELY AND IN THE FORMS READY FOR VIBRATION WITHIN 1-1/2
HOURS AFTER BATCHING
3. CONCRETE SHALL BE PLACED IN MAXIMUM 15 MINUTES AFTER ITS ARRIVAL TO
THE SITE, AND THE FINISHING OF PLACEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE
CEMENT STARTS SETTING.
4. CONCRETE SHALL BE STORED / DEPOSITED AS NEAR AS (PHYSICALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY) POSSIBLE TO ITS FINAL POSITION, IN CRANE HOISTED BUCKETS,
CONCRETE PUMPS, CHUTES ETC.
5. THE RECEPTACLES USED FOR THE TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION OF CONCRETE
SHALL BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT AT THE END OF EACH DAY'S WORK AND
WHENEVER CONCRETING IS INTERRUPTED FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES.
6. IF THE CONCRETE, DUE TO TRANSPORT, IS SEGREGATED. IT SHOULD BE MIXED
AGAIN ON CLEAN PLATFORMS, WITHOUT ADDING WATER.
7. AS PLACING BEGINS THE CONSISTENCY OF THE DELIVERED CONCRETE SHOULD
BE CHECKED WITH A SLUMP CONE FOR CONFORMANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS
AND THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF SAMPLES MUST BE TAKEN (1 SAMPLE = 3
SPECIMENS) ACCORDING TO THE VOLUME OF CONCRETE PLACED.
8. CONCRETE SHALL BE PLACED TO PREVENT SEGREGATION. THE CONCRETE SHALL
NOT BE PERMITTED TO STRIKE AGAINST FORMS AND RICOCHET ON BARS AND
FORM FACES. THE FREE FALL OF CONCRETE SHOULD IN NO CASE EXCEED 1.5 M.
FOR GREATER HEIGHTS, AS IN WALLS OR COLUMNS, METAL OR RUBBER HOPPERS,
CHUTES OR FLEXIBLE HOSES MUST BE LOWERED INTO THE FORMWORK TO
CONTROL THE RATE OF FALL OF THE CONCRETE, IF NOT THE CONCRETE WILL FLOW
RAPIDLY ENTERING THE FORMS INVARIABLY RESULTING SEPARATION AND
HONEYCOMBING.
9. WHEN CONCRETE IS DUMPED FROM A CART OR WHEELBARROW, THERE IS A
TENDENCY FOR THE HEAVIER PARTICLES TO SEPARATE FROM THE MASS. TO
PREVENT THIS, THE CONCRETE SHOULD BE DISCHARGED AGAINST A STRIKING
(BAFFLE) BOARD.

B. WHAT ARE THE ROLE OF WATER IN CONCRETE 7 EXPLUIN WHAT ARE
THE SOURCES OF AGGREGATES ?

SP-17D ()
TECHNOLOGY
&
ROLE OF WATER IN CONCRETE :
WATER IS THE KEY INGREDIENT, WHICH WHEN MIXED WITH CEMENT, FORMS
1.
B PASTE THAT BINDS THE AGGREGATE TOGETHER.
2
THE WATER CAUSES THE HARDENING OF CONCRETE THROUGH A PROCESS
CALLED HYDRATION. HYDRATION IS A CHEMICAL REACTION IN WHICH THE
MAJOR COMPOUNDS IN CEMENT FORM CHEMICAL BONDS WITH WATER
MOLECULES AND BECOME HYDRATES OR HYDRATION PRODUCTS.
3.
THE ROLE OF WATER IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER TO CEMENT RATIO IS
THE MOST CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE PRODUCTION OF "PERFECT" CONCRETE. TOO
MUCH WATER REDUCES CONCRETE STRENGTH, WHILE TOO LITTLE WILL MAKE
THE CONCRETE UNWORKABLE.
4. CONCRETE NEEDS TO BE WORKABLE SO THAT IT MAY BE CONSOLIDATED AND
SHAPED INTO DIFFERENT FORMS (I.E., WALLS, DOMES, ETC.). BECAUSE
CONCRETE MUST BE BOTH STRONG AND WORKABLE, A CAREFUL BALANCE OF
THE CEMENT TO WATER RATIO IS REQUIRED WHEN MAKING CONCRETE.
B. SOURCE OF AGGREGATE:
1. ALMOST ALL NATURAL AGGREGATE MATERIALS FROM BED ROCKS.
2. THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF ROCKS, NAMELY, IGNEOUS, SEDIMENTARY AND
METAMORPHIC.
3. THE IGNEOUS ROCKS ARE FORMED BY THE COOLING OF MOLTEN MAGMA OR
LAVA AT THE SURFACE OF THE CREST (TRAP AND BASALT) OR DEEP BENEATH THE
CREST (GRANITE).
4. THE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS ARE FORMED ORIGINALLY BELOW THE SEA BED AND
SUBSEQUENTLY LIFTED UP.
5. METAMORPHIC ROCKS ARE ORIGINALLY EITHER IGNEOUS OR SEDIMENTARY
ROCKS WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY METAMORPHOSED DUE TO EXTREME HEAT
AND PRESSURE.
AGGREGATES FROM IGNEOUS ROCKS :
I.
MOST IGNEOUS ROCKS MAKE HIGHLY SATISFACTORY CONCRETE AGGREGATES
BECAUSE THEY ARE NORMALLY HARD, TOUGH AND DENSE.
II. THE IGNEOUS ROCKS HAVE MASSIVE STRUCTURE, ENTIRELY CRYSTALLINE OR
WHOLLY GLASSY OR IN COMBINATION IN BETWEEN, DEPENDING UPON THE
RATE AT WHICH THEY WHERE COOLED DURING FORMATION.
III. THEY MAY BE ACIDIC OR BASIC DEPENDING UPON THE PERCENTAGE OF SILICA
CONTENT. THEY MAY OCCUR LIGHT COLOURED OR DARK COLOURED.
IV. THE IGNEOUS ROCKS AS A CLASS ARE THE MOST CHEMICALLY ACTIVE CONCRETE
AGGREGATE AND SHOW 11 TENDOWEY TO RENET WITH THE ALKALINE IN CEMENT.
V. AS THE IGNOOUS ROCK IS ONE OF THE WIDELY OCCURRING TYPE OF ROCKS ON
THE FACO OF THE EARTH, BULK OF THE CONCRETE AGGREGATES, THAT ARE
DERIVED, ARE OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN.

SP-18D ()
SOLVED PAPER (2019-20)
AGGREGATES FROM SEDIMENTARY ROCKS :
I. IGNEOUS ROCKS OR METAMORPHIC ROCKS ARE SUBJECTED TO WEATHERING
AGENCIES SUCH AS SUN, RAIN AND WIND.
IL. THESE WEATHERING AGENCIES DECOMPOSE, FRAGMENTISE, TRANSPORT AND
DEPOSIT THE PARTICLES OF ROCK, DEEP BENEATH THE OCEAN BED WHERE
THEY ARE CEMENTED TOGETHER BY SOME OF THE CEMENTING MATERIALS.
III. THE CEMENTING MATERIALS COULD BE CARBONACEOUS, SILICEOUS OR
ARGILLACEOUS IN NATURE. AT THE SAME TIME THE DEPOSITED AND CEMENTED
MATERIAL GETS SUBJECTED TO STATIC PRESSURE OF WATER AND BECOMES
COMPACT SEDIMENTARY ROCK LAYER.
AGGREGATES FROM METAMORPHIC ROCKS :
I. BOTH IGNEOUS ROCKS AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS MAY BE SUBJECTED TO
HIGH TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE WHICH CAUSES METAMORPHISM WHICH
CHANGES THE STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE OF ROCKS.
II. THE THICKNESS OF THIS FOLIATION MAY VARY FROM A FEW CENTIMETRES TO
MANY METRES.
III. IF THE THICKNESS OF THIS FOLIATION IS LESS, THEN INDIVIDUAL AGGREGATE
MAY EXHIBIT FOLIATION WHICH IS NOT A DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTIC IN
AGGREGATE.
IV. HOWEVER, MANY METAMORPHIC ROCKS PARTICULARLY QUARTZITE AND GNEISS
HAVE BEEN USED FOR PRODUCTION OF GOOD CONCRETE AGGREGATES.

WORKABILITY OF CONCRETE.
ANC REFER Q. 4.7, PAGE 4-8D, UNIT-4.
B. DEFINE LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE AND EXPLAIN IN DETAIL THE
CLASSIFICATION OF LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE.
ANS. LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE :
1. LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE MIXTURE IS MADE WITH A LIGHT WEIGHT COARSE
AGGREGATE AND SOMETIMES A PORTION OR ENTIRE FINE AGGREGATES MAY
BE LIGHT WEIGHT INSTEAD OF NORMAL AGGREGATES.
2. STRUCTURAL LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE HAS AN IN-PLACE DENSITY (UNIT
WEIGHT) ON THE ORDER OF 1440 TO 1840 KG/M�.
3. NORMAL WEIGHT CONCRETE A DENSITY IN THE RANGE OF 2240 TO
2400 KG/M�.
4. LIGHT WEIGHT AGGREGATES USED IN STRUCTURAL LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE
ARE TYPICALLY EXPANDED SHALE, CLAY OR SLATE MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN


SP-19D()
FIRED IN A ROTARY KILN TO DEVELOP A POROUS STRUCTURE. OTHER PRODUCTS
SUCH AS AIR-COOLED BLAST FURNACE SLAG ARE ALSO USED.
5. THERE ARE OTHER CLASSES OF NON-STRUCTURAL LWC WITH LOWER DENSITY
MADE WITH OTHER AGGREGATE MATERIALS AND HIGHER AIR VOIDS IN THE
CERNENT PASTE MATRIX, SUCH AS IN CELLULAR CONCRETE.
CLASSIFICATION OF LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE : THERE ARE THREE BROAD
CLASSIFICATIONS OF LIGHT WEIGHT CONCRETE BASED ON THE METHOD
EMPLOYED FOR PRODUCTION.
1. LIGHT WEIGHT AGGREGATE CONCRETE : IN THIS METHOD A POROUS
LIGHT WEIGHT AGGREGATE OF LOW SPECIFIC GRAVITY INSTEAD OF NORMAL
AGGREGATE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY 2.6 IS USED.
2. AERATED, CELLULAR, FOAMED OR GAS CONCRETE : LARGE VOIDS
(GAS BUBBLES) ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE CONCRETE OR MORTAR TO PRODUCE
A CELLULAR MASS.
3. NO-FINES CONCRETE : IN THIS METHOD THE FINE AGGREGATES ARE NOT
USED AND ONLY COARSE AGGREGATES ARE USED IN CONCRETE AS A RESULT
LARGE VOIDS ARE LEFT REDUCING THE DENSITY OF CONCRETE AND HENCE THE
WEIGHT.
7. ATTEMPT ANY ONE PART OF THE FOLLOWING :
(7 X 1 = 7)
A. DESCRIBE RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE STATUS IN INDIA.

MATERIALS FOR CREATING THESE FACILITIES ARE NEEDED.
2. THE PLANNING COMMISSION ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY 50 % OF CAPITAL
OUTLAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IN SUCCESSIVE 10TH AND 11TH
FIVE YEAR PLANS.
3. RAPID INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS HIGHWAYS, AIRPORTS ETC.
AND GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS LED TO SCARCITY AND RISE IN COST
OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.
4.
MOST OF WASTE MATERIALS PRODUCED BY DEMOLISHED STRUCTURES DISPOSED
OFF BY DUMPING THEM AS LANDFILL. DUMPING OF WASTES ON LAND IS
CAUSING SHORTAGE OF DUMPING PLACE IN URBAN AREAS. THEREFORE, IT IS
NECESSARY TO START RECYCLING AND REUSE OF DEMOLITION CONCRETE WASTE
TO SAVE ENVIRONMENT, COST AND ENERGY.
5. CENTRAL POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD HAS ESTIMATED CURRENT QUANTUM OF
SOLID WASTE GENERATION IN INDIA TO THE TUNE OF 48 MILLION TONS PER
