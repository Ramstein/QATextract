TYPES OF ESTIMATE:
I.
APPROXIMATE ESTIMATES
N.
DETAILED ESTIMATES.
METHOD OF ESTIMATION : THERE ARE TWO METHODS FOR CIVIL WORK
ESTIMATION :
I.
CENTER LINE METHOD.
II.
LONG AND SHORT WALL METHOD.


QUE 1.1.
WHAT IS ESTIMATION ? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ESTIMATION ?
ANSWER
ESTIMATION : IT IS THE PROCESS WHICH GUIDES US TO DETERMINE THE COST,
QUANTITY, TOOLS, PLANTS AND LABOURS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE
PROJECT WITH IN TIME OF COMPLETION.
PURPOSE OF ESTIMATION : FOLLOWING ARE THE PURPOSES OF ESTIMATION :
1.
TO GIVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE IDEA OF THE COST : AN ESTIMATE IS
NECESSARY TO GIVE THE OWNER A REASONABLY ACCURATE IDEA OF THE COST TO
HELP HIM DECIDE WHETHER THE WORK CAN BE UNDERTAKEN AS PROPOSED OR
NOT, DEPENDING UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.
2
ESTIMATING MATERIALS : FROM THE ESTIMATE OF A WORK IT IS POSSIBLE TO
DETERMINE WHAT MATERIALS (AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES) WILL BE REQUIRED FOR
THE WORK SO THAT ARRANGEMENTS TO PROCURE THEM CAN BE MADE.
3.
ESTIMATING LABOUR : THE NUMBER AND KIND OF WORKERS OF DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES WHO WILL HAVE TO BE EMPLOYED TO COMPLETE THE WORK IN THE
SPECIFIED TIME CAN BE FOUND OUT FROM THE ESTIMATE.
4.
ESTIMATING PLANT : AN ESTIMATE WILL HELP IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT
AND KIND OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE WORK.


1-3 C ()
5
ESTIMATING TIME : THE ESTIMATE OF A WORK AND PAST EXPERIENCE ENABLE
ONE TO ESTIMATE QUITE CLOSELY THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN
ITEM OF WORK OR THE WORK AS A WHOLE.
QUE 1.2.
DESCRIBE THE TYPES OF ESTIMATES.
ANSWER
TYPES OF ESTIMATES : ESTIMATES CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO MAIN CATEGORIES :
A.
APPROXIMATE ESTIMATES: AN APPROXIMATE ESTIMATE IS AN APPROXIMATE
OR ROUGH ESTIMATE PREPARED TO OBTAIN AN APPROXIMATE COST IN A SHORT
TIME.
B.
DETAILED ESTIMATES:
1
A DETAILED ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF A PROJECT IS PREPARED BY DETERMINING
THE QUANTITIES AND COSTS OF EVERYTHING THAT A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO
PROVIDE AND DO FOR THE SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF THE WORK.
2
IT IS THE BEST AND MOST RELIABLE FORM OF ESTIMATE.
3.
A DETAILED ESTIMATE MAY BE PREPARED IN THE FOLLOWING TWO WAYS :
I
UNIT-QUANTITY METHOD :
A
IN THE UNIT-QUANTITY METHOD, THE WORK IS DIVIDED INTO AS MANY
OPERATIONS OR ITEMS AS ARE REQUIRED.
B.
A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT IS DECIDED.
C.
THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF WORK UNDER EACH ITEM IS TAKEN OUT IN THE
PROPER UNIT OF MEASUREMENT.
D
THE TOTAL COST PER UNIT QUANTITY OF EACH ITEM IS ANALYSED AND WORKED
OUT.
E.
THEN THE TOTAL COST FOR THE ITEM IS FOUND BY MULTIPLYING THE COST
PER UNIT QUANTITY BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS.
F.
THIS METHOD HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE UNIT COSTS ON VARIOUS JOBS
CAN BE READILY COMPARED AND THAT THE TOTAL ESTIMATE CAN EASILY BE
CORRECTED FOR VARIATIONS IN QUANTITIES.
II.
TOTAL-QUANTITY METHOD : IN THIS METHOD, AN ITEM OF WORK IS DIVIDED
INTO THE FOLLOWING FIVE SUBDIVISIONS :
A MATERIALS,
B. LABOUR,
C. PLANT,
D.
OVERHEADS, AND
E. PROFIT.
THE TOTAL QUANTITIES OF EACH KIND OR CLASS OF MATERIAL OR LABOUR ARE
FOUND AND MULTIPLIED BY THEIR INDIVIDUAL UNIT COST. SIMILARLY, THE COST OF
PLANT, OVERHEAD EXPENSES AND PROFIT ARE DETERMINED.

QUANTITY ESTIMATION FOR BUILDINGS
QUE 1.3.
WHAT ARE THE MAIN STEPS IN PREPARATION OF ESTIMATE ?
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS IN THE PREPARATION OF AN ESTIMATE :
1.
TAKING OUT QUANTITIES :
I.
IN THE FIRST STEP OF TAKING OUT QUANTITIES, THE MEASUREMENTS ARE TAKEN
OFF FROM THE DRAWINGS AND ENTERED ON MEASUREMENT SHEET OR DIMENSION
PAPER.
II.
THE MEASUREMENTS TO BE TAKEN OUT WOULD DEPEND UPON THE UNIT OF
MEASUREMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF STONE MASONRY LENGTH,
THICKNESS AND HEIGHT OF THE WALLS WOULD BE ENTERED ON THE MEASUREMENT
SHEET, WHEREAS, IN THE CASE OF PLASTERING ONLY THE LENGTHS AND HEIGHT OF
THE WALLS WOULD BE ENTERED.
2.
SQUARING OUT : THE SECOND STEP CONSISTS OF WORKING OUT VOLUMES,
AREAS AND SO ON, AND CASTING UP THEIR TOTAL IN RECOGNISED UNITS.
3.
ABSTRACTING :
I.
IN THE THIRD STEP, ALL ITEMS ALONG WITH THE NET RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE
SECOND STEP ARE TRANSFERRED FROM MEASUREMENT SHEETS TO SPECIALLY
RULED SHEETS HAVING RATE COLUMN READY FOR PRICING.
II.
THE SECOND AND THIRD STEPS ABOVE ARE KNOWN AS *WORKING UP'.
ALL CALCULATIONS IN THESE STAGES AND EVERY ENTRY TRANSFERRED SHOULD BE
CHECKED BY ANOTHER PERSON TO ENSURE THAT NO MATHEMATICAL OR COPYING
ERROR OCCURS.
QUE 1.4.
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF DECIDING UNIT OF
MEASUREMENT ?
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION OF UNIT OF MEASUREMENT :
1.
THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT TO MEASURE,
RECORD AND UNDERSTAND.
2.
IT SHOULD BE ONE WHICH PROVIDES FOR FAIR PAYMENT FOR THE WORK INVOLVED.
3.
IN THE RESULT IT SHOULD YIELD QUANTITIES WHICH ARE NEITHER TOO MINUTE NOR
TOO LARGE.
4.
THE PRICE PER UNIT SHOULD NOT BE A VERY SMALL FIGURE OR A VERY LARGE ONE,
THAT IS, GENERALLY COSTLIER ITEMS WILL BE MEASURED IN SMALLER UNITS, CHEAPER
ONES IN LARGER UNITS.
5.
THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT MAY SOMETIMES DEPEND UPON THE UNIT FOR THE
RAW MATERIAL AND/OR LABOUR AND/OR IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
STONE MASONRY IS MEASURED IN CUBIC METRES BECAUSE RAW MATERIALS ARE
MEASURED IN CUBIC METRES. PLASTERING OR POINTING IS MEASURED IN SQUARE
METRES AS THE LABOUR IS CONSIDERABLE.

QUE N.5.
WHAT ARE ITEM OF WORKS ? WRITE THE UNITS REQUIRED TO
MEASURE THEM.
ANSWER
ITEMS OF WORKS : FOLLOWING ARE THE MAIN ITEMS OF WORKS AND THEIR
MEASURE UNITS
L
EARTHWORK : EARTHWORK IN EXESVATION AND EARTHWORK IN FILLING ARE
USUALLY TAKEN OUT SEPARATELY UNDER DIFFERENT ITEMS AND QUANTITIES ARE
CALCULATED IN M�.
2
CONCRETE IN FOUNDATION : THE CONCRETE IS TAKEN OUT IN M� BY LENGTH
X
BREADTH X THICKNESS THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF FOUNDATION CONCRETE
ARE USUALLY THE SAME AS FOR EXCAVATION ONLY THE DEPTH OR THICKNESS
DIFFERS.
3
SOILING: WHEN THE SOIL IS SOFT OR BAD. ONE LAYER OF DRY BRICK OR STONE
SOLING IS APPLIED BELOW THE FOUNDATION CONCRETE. THE SOLING LAYER IS
COMPUTED IN M�(LENGTH X BREADTH) SPECIFYING THE THICKNESS.
4
DAMP PROOF COURSE (DPC) : IT IS USUALLY OF 2.5 CM THICK RICH CEMENT
CONCRETE 1 : 1.5 : 3 OR 2 CM THICK RICH CEMENT MORTAR 1 : 2, MIXED WITH
STANDARD WATER PROOFING MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AT THE PLINTH LEVEL TO FULL
WIDTH OF PLINTH WALL AND THE QUANTITIES ARE COMPUTED IN M� (LENGTH
X
BREADTHI.
5. MASONRY : IT IS COMPUTED IN M� (L X B X H). FOUNDATION AND PLINTH
MASONRY IS TAKEN UNDER ONE ITEM, AND MASONRY IN SUPERSTRUCTURE IS
TAKEN UNDER A SEPARATE ITEM.
QUE 1.6.
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS METHOD OF ESTIMATION ? EXPLAIN IN
BRIEF
OR
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ESTIMATION ? WHICH METHOD YOU
ADOPT FOR OCTAGONAL BAY FRONT BUILDING ?
ANSWER
METHODS OF ESTIMATION FOR BUILDING WORKS : THE ESTIMATION OF
BUILDING QUANTITIES LIKE EARTH WORK, FOUNDATION CONCRETE, BRICKWORK IN
PLINTH AND SUPERSTRUCTURE ETC. CAN BE WORKED OUT BY LONG WALL-SHORT WALL
METHOD AND CENTER LINE METHOD.
1.
LONG WALL-SHORT WALL METHOD :
I.
IN THIS METHOD, THE WALL ALONG THE LENGTH OF ROOM IS CONSIDERED TO BE LONG
WALL WHILE THE WALL PERPENDICULAR TO LONG WALL IS SAID TO BE SHORT WALL.
II.
TO GET THE LENGTH OF LONGWALL OR SHORTWALL, CALCULATE FIRST THE CENTRE LINE
LENGTHS OF INDIVIDUAL WALLS. THEN THE LENGTH OF LONG WALL (OUT TO OUT) MAY
BE CALCULATED AFTER ADDING HALF BREADTH AT EACH END TO ITS CENTRE LINE
LENGTH.

1-6 C ()
QUANTITY ESTIMATION FOR BUILDINGS
III.
THUS THE LENGTH OF SHORT WALL MEASURED IN TO IN AND MAY BE FOUND BY
DEDUCTING HALF BREADTH FROM ITS CENTRE LINE LENGTH AT EACH END.
IV. THE LENGTH OF LONG WALL USUALLY DECREASES FROM EARTH WORK TO BRICK WORK
IN SUPER STRUCTURE WHILE THE SHORT WALL INCREASES. THESE LENGTHS ARE
MULTIPLIED BY BREADTH AND DEPTH TO GET QUANTITIES.
2
CENTRE LINE METHOD :
I.
THIS METHOD IS SUITABLE FOR WALLS OF SIMILAR CROSS SECTIONS. HERE THE TOTAL
CENTRE LINE LENGTH IS MULTIPLIED BY BREADTH AND DEPTH OF RESPECTIVE ITEM
TO GET THE TOTAL QUANTITY AT A TIME.
II.
WHEN CROSS WALLS OR PARTITIONS OR VERANDAH WALLS JOIN WITH MAIN WALL,
THE CENTRE LINE LENGTH GETS REDUCED BY HALF OF BREADTH FOR EACH JUNCTION.
III.
SUCH JUNCTION OR JOINTS ARE STUDIED CAREFULLY WHILE CALCULATING TOTAL CENTRE
LINE LENGTH. THE ESTIMATES PREPARED BY THIS METHOD ARE MOST ACCURATE
AND QUICK.
IV. CENTER LINE METHOD IS SUITABLY USED FOR ESTIMATING CIRCULAR, RECTANGULAR.
HEXAGONAL, OCTAGONAL ETC., SHAPED BUILDING
3.
PARTLY CENTRE LINE AND PARTLY CROSS WALL METHOD :
I.
THIS METHOD IS ADOPTED WHEN EXTERNAL (I.E., AROUND THE BUILDING) WALL IS
OF ONE THICKNESS AND THE INTERNAL WALLS HAVING DIFFERENT THICKNESSES. IN
SUCH CASES, CENTRE LINE METHOD IS APPLIED TO EXTERNAL WALLS AND LONG WALL-
SHORT WALL METHOD IS USED TO INTERNAL WALLS.
II.
THIS METHOD SUITS FOR DIFFERENT THICKNESSES WALLS AND DIFFERENT LEVEL OF
FOUNDATIONS. BECAUSE OF THIS REASON, ALL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS ARE
PRACTICING THIS METHOD.

ESTIMATE BY CENTRE LINE METHOD THE QUANTITIES OF THE
FOLLOWING ITEMS OF A SINGLE ROOM BUILDING AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 1.7.1.
1.
EARTHWORK IN EXCAVATION IN FOUNDATION,
2.
CONCRETE IN FOUNDATION,
3.
BRICKWORK IN FOUNDATION AND PLINTH, AND
4.
BRICKWORK IN SUPERSTRUCTURE.
ANSWER
1.
TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH OF WALLS = AB + BC + CD + DA = 5.30 + 4.30 + 5.30
+ 4.30 = 19.20 M FIGURE. 1.8.1 REPRESENTS THE FOUNDATION TRENCH PLAN.
2.
IF THE TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH IS MULTIPLIED BY THE BREADTH AND THE DEPTH, WE
GET THE QUANTITY OF EARTHWORK IN EXCAVATION. BY DOING SO WE TAKE
CERTAIN PORTION TWICE AND LEAVE AN EQUAL PORTION BUT THIS DOES NOT AFFECT
THE QUANTITY.
3.
THE QUANTITY OF EXCAVATION = AB X 90 CM X 90 CM + BC X 90 CM X 90 CM
+ CD X 90 CM X 90 CM + DA X 90 CM X 90 CM.
4. IT MAY BE NOTICED THAT THE PORTIONS P, Q, R AND S MARKED WITH DOUBLE
HATCH LINES COME TWICE WHILE THE PORTIONS K, L, M, N LEFT BLANK DO NOT
COME AT ALL, BUT THESE PORTIONS BEING EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE, WE GET THE
CORRECT QUANTITY.

ANSWER
1.
IN THIS PROBLEM THERE ARE TWO JUNCTIONS OF THE INTER WALL WITH THE MAIN
WALL.
2.
TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH OF WALL = 2 X C/C OF LONG WALL + 3 X C/C OF SHORT WALL.
= 2 X 10.60 + 3 X 6.30 = 40.10 M

3.
IF THE TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH IS MULTIPLIED BY THE BREADTH AND DEPTH, AT THE
JUNCTION THE PORTIONS A AND B SHOWN BY HATCH LINES IN FIGURE. 1.11.2 COME
TWICE, AND WE GET THE QUANTITY IN EXCESS BY THESE PORTIONS, AND THESE
EXCESSES SHALL HAVE TO BE DEDUCTED.
4.
THE DEDUCTION MAY BE EFFECTED REDUCING THE CENTRE LENGTH BY HALF
BREADTH FOR EACH JUNCTION.
5.
THUS THE QUANTITY OF EARTHWORK IN EXCAVATION :
=
[TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH - (2 X 1/2 BREADTH)] X BREADTH X DEPTH
= 1.10) X 1.10 X 1.00 = 39.00 X 1.10 X 1.00 = 42.9 CU M.
6.
THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO FOUNDATION CONCRETE, TO FOOTINGS, PLINTH
WALL AND SUPERSTRUCTURE WALL.
7.
AT EVERY STAGE DEDUCTION OF HALF BREADTH OF THE MAIN WALL AT THAT
PARTICULAR LEVEL SHALL HAVE TO BE MADE PER JUNCTION (I.E. ONE BREADTH FOR
TWO JUNCTIONS) FROM THE TOTAL CENTRE LENGTH, AND THIS NET CENTRE LENGTH
AFTER DEDUCTION SHALL BE MULTIPLIED BY THE RESPECTIVE BREADTH AND THE
HEIGHT OF DEPTH TO GET QUANTITIES.

QUE 2.1.
WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY 'ANALYSIS OF RATES' ? WHAT
ARE PURPOSES OF RATE OF ANALYSIS ?
ANSWER
1.
THE METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF RATE PER UNIT OF A PARTICULAR ITEM OF
WORK CONSIDERING THE COST OF QUANTITIES OF MATERIALS, THE COST OF LABOURS,
HIRE OF TOOLS AND PLANTS, OVERHEAD CHARGES, WATER CHARGES, CONTRACTORS
PROFIT ETC., IS KNOWN AS RATE ANALYSIS OR ANALYSIS OF RATE.
2.
RATES OF MATERIALS ARE USUALLY TAKEN AS THE RATES DELIVERED AT THE SITE OF
WORK AND INCLUDE THE FIRST COST (COST AT ORIGIN), COST OF TRANSPORT, RAILWAY
FREIGHT (IF ANY), TAXES ETC.
3.
IF THE MATERIALS ARE TO BE CARRIED FROM A DISTANT PLACE, MORE THAN S KM.
ADDITIONAL COST OF TRANSPORT MAY BE ADDED.

CONTRACTOR'S PROFIT IS ADDED ON ALL ITEMS OF THE PARTICULAR WORK WHICH
HAVE BEEN ARRANGED BY HIM.
PURPOSES OF RATE ANALYSIS : THE PURPOSES OF RATE ANALYSIS ARE AS
FOLLOWS :
1.
TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT RATE PER UNIT OF AN ITEM OF WORK AT THE LOCALITY.
2.
TO EXAMINE THE VIABILITY OF RATES QUOTED BY CONTRACTORS.


2-30 ()
3.
TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS AND LABOUR STRENGTHS REQUIRED TO
COMPLETE THE PROJECT.
4.
TO REVISE THE SCHEDULE OF RATES DUE TO INCREASE IN THE COST OF MATERIALA
AND LABOUR OR DUE TO CHANGED SITUATIONS.

ANALYSIS OF RATES, SPECIFICATION AND TENDERS

SPECIFICATION.
CCEPT :
SPECIFICATION : A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DIMENSIONS, CONSTRUCTION,
WORKMANSHIP, MATERIALS ETC., OF WORK DONE OR TO BE DONE, PREPARED BY
AN ARCHITECT ENGINEERS ETC.
TYPE OF SPECIFICATION : THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SPECIFICATION:
I.
GENERAL SPECIFICATION.
II.
DETAILED SPECIFICATION.


QUE 2.11.
WHAT IS SPECIFICATION AND ITS OBJECTS ? ALSO EXPLAIN ITS
TYPES.
ANSWER
SPECIFICATION : A SPECIFICATION IS A STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS.
CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS MAY BE DEFINED AS WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS
DISTINGUISHING (OR LIMITING) AND DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THE CONSTRUCTION
WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN.
OBJECTS : FOLLOWING ARE THE OBJECTS OF SPECIFICATION :
1.
CONTRACT DOCUMENT : SPECIFICATIONS SERVE AS A CONTRACT DOCUMENT
BETWEEN THE OWNER AND THE CONTRACTOR, LIMITING AND DESCRIBING THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES.
2.
GUIDE TO BIDDERS : SPECIFICATIONS ENABLE THE ESTIMATORS OF THE
CONTRACTORS TO ARRIVE AT A FAIR PRICE FOR THE WORK INVOLVED
3.
GUIDE TO SUPERVISORS : SPECIFICATIONS SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR THE
FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT.
TYPES OF SPECIFICATION : FOLLOWING ARE THE TWO TYPES OF SPECIFICATION :
1.
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS :
I.
IN GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS, NATURE AND CLASS OF WORKS AND NAMES OF
MATERIALS THAT SHOULD BE USED ARE DESCRIBED
II.
ONLY A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH AND EVERY ITEM IS GIVEN. IT IS USEFUL FOR
ESTIMATING THE PROJECT.


2-13 C (CE-SEM-�
IL
THE GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS DO NOT FORM A PART OF CONTRACT DOCUMENT
2
DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS :
I
THE DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS FORM A PART OF A CONTRACT DOCUMENT.
IL
THEY SPECIFY THE QUALITIES, QUANTITIES AND PROPORTIONS OF MATERIALS AND
THE METHOD OF PREPARATION AND EXECUTION FOR A PARTICULAR ITEM OF
IN A PROJECT.
IL
THE DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT ITEMS OF THE WORK ARE PREPARED
SEPARATELY AND THEY DESCRIBE WHAT THE WORK SHOULD BE AND HOW THEY
SHALL BE EXECUTED.
IV.
WHILE WRITING THE DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS, THE SAME ORDER SEQUENCE AS
THE WORK IS TO BE CARRIED OUT IS TO BE MAINTAINED.
QUE 2.12.
DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF DETAILED SPECIFICATION.
ANSWER
IMPORTANCE OF SPECIFICATIONS : FOLLOWING ARE THE IMPORTANCE DI
SPECIFICATIONS :
1.
THE COST OF A UNIT QUANTITY OF WORK IS GOVERNED BY ITS SPECIFICATIONS
2.
SPECIFICATION OF A WORK IS REQUIRED TO DESCRIBE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY
OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR A CONSTRUCTION WORK AND IS ONE OF
THE ESSENTIAL CONTRACT DOCUMENTS.
3.
THIS ALSO SPECIFIES THE WORKMANSHIP AND THE METHOD OF DOING THE WORK
4.
A WORK IS CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO ITS SPECIFICATION AND THE CONTRACTORI
PAID FOR THE SAME. ANY CHANGE IN SPECIFICATION CHANGES THE TENDERED
RATE.
5.
AS THE RATE OF WORK IS BASED ON THE SPECIFICATION, A CONTRACTOR CEE
CALCULATE THE RATES OF VARIOUS ITEMS OF WORKS IN TENDER WITH HIS
PROCUREMENT RATES OF MATERIALS AND LABOUR. THUS TENDER RATE WITHOUT
SPECIFICATION OF WORKS IS BASELESS, INCOMPLETE AND INVALID.
6.
SPECIFICATION IS NECESSARY TO SPECIFY THE EQUIPMENT TOOLS AND PLANTS TE
BE ENGAGED FOR A WORK AND THUS ENABLES TO PROCURE THEM BEFOREHAND
7.
THE NECESSITY OF SPECIFICATION IS TO VERIFY AND CHECK THE STRENGTH D
MATERIALS FOR A WORK INVOLVED IN A PROJECT.

VARIOUS LAWS :
I
THE LAW OF CONTRACTS IS THE BASIS OF BUSINESS LAW BECAUSE THE BULK OF
TRANSACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN TRADE, COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY ARE
BASED ON CONTRACTS.
IL
IN INDIA, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS IS CONTAINED IN THE INDIAN CONTRACT ACT,
1872

WRITE SHORT NOTES ON LAND ACQUISITION IN INDIA.
ANSWER
LAND ACQUISITION : IT REFERS TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE UNION OR A
STATE GOVERNMENT IN INDIA ACQUIRES PRIVATE LAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF
INDUSTRIALIZATION, DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITATES OR
URBANIZATION OF THE PRIVATE LAND AND PROVIDES COMPENSATION TO THE
AFFECTED LAND OWNERS AND THEIR REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT.
FOLLOWING ARE THE TWO BASES OF LAND ACQUIRED IN INDIA :
1.
PERMANENT LAND : LAND IS TO BE ACQUIRED PERMANENTLY FOR THE
EXPECTED LIFE OF THE PROJECT.
FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THE CASE OF LAYING A NEW PIPELINE. LAND IS ACQUIRED
PERMANENTLY ALONG THE PIPELINE ROUTE AND THE FACILITY SITES SUCH AS
PUMP STATIONS, METERING STATIONS, BLOCK VALVE STATION, ANODE GROUND
BEDS, POWER LINE PYLONS, ETC.
2
TEMPORARY LAND :
I.
ALL AREAS WHICH ARE NEEDED IN ADDITION TO THE PERMANENTLY ACQUIRE LAND
IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF THE PIPOLINES
SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES ARE ACQUIRED ON TEMPORARY BASIS.
II.
THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTOR CAMP, STORAGE YARDS AND OTHER NUXILIARY ARENS
NEEDED FOR THE STORAGE OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS.
THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK :
THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, 1894".

2-22 C ()
ANALYSIS OF RATES, SPECIFICATION AND TENDERS
I.
LAND CAN BE ACQUIRED EITHER BY STATE OR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOR
THE PURPOSE LISTED UNDER STATE AND CENTRE LIST RESPECTIVELY UNLESS THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DELEGATES THE TASK TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT UNDER
ARTICLE 258(1) OF CONSTITUTION.
II.
ARTICLE 31(2) CATEGORICALLY STATES THAT A LAND CAN BE ACQUIRED BY THE
STATE ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC PURPOSE.
III.
IN EVERY CASE, LAND ACQUISITION MUST TAKE PLACE IN A MANNER THAT FULLY
PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF LAND OWNER AND ALSO OF THOSE WHOSE LIVELIHOOD
DEPENDS ON THE LAND BEING ACQUIRED.

OR
EXPLAIN VARIOUS TYPES OF CONTRACT SYSTEM WITH ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES.
10
ANSWER
TYPES OF CONTRACT : THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CONTRACTS
FOR EXECUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING WORKS, WITH THEIR RELATIVE MERITS AND
DEMERITS :
1.
ITEM RATE CONTRACT :
T

2-24 C ()
ANALYSIS OF RATES, SPECIFICATION AND TENDERS
I.
ITEM RATE CONTRACT IS ALSO KNOWN AS UNIT PRICE CONTRACT OR SCHEDULE
CONTRACT.
II.
A CONTRACT UNDERTAKES THE EXECUTION OF WORK ON AN ITEM RATE BASIS.
III.
HE IS REQUIRED TO QUOTE RATE FOR INDIVIDUAL ITEM OF WORK ON THE BASIS OF
SCHEDULE OF QUANTITIES (I.E., BILL OF QUANTITIES) FURNISHED BY THE
DEPARTMENT.
IV.
THE AMOUNT TO BE RECEIVED BY THE CONTRACTION DEPENDS UPON THE
QUANTITIES OF WORK ACTUALLY PERFORMED.
V.
THE PAYMENT TO THE CONTRACTOR IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE DETAILED
MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENT ITEMS OF WORK ACTUALLY EXECUTED BY HIM.
MERITS :
I.
THIS METHOD ENSURES A VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS OF COST AND PAYMENT TO THE
CONTRACTOR AND IS BASED UPON DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF EACH ITEM ACTUALLY
DONE, SO THIS METHOD IS MORE SCIENTIFIC.
II.
CHANGES IN DRAWINGS AND QUANTITIES OF INDIVIDUAL ITEM CAN BE MADE AS
PER REQUIREMENTS WITHIN AGREED LIMITS.
DEMERITS :
I.
THE TOTAL COST OF WORK CAN ONLY BE KNOWN AFTER COMPLETION. AS SUCH THE
OWNER MAY FACE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IF THE FINAL COST IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGH.
II.
ADDITIONAL STAFF IS REQUIRED TO TAKE DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF WORK.
III.
THE SCOPE OF SAVING WITH USE OF INFERIOR QUALITY MATERIALS MAY PROMPT
THE CONTRACTOR TO DO SO.
2
PERCENTAGE RATE CONTRACT :
I.
IN THIS FORM OF CONTRACT, THE DEPARTMENT DRAWS UP 'ITEM RATE TENDER' I.E.,
BILL OF QUANTITIES WITH RATE, AMOUNT AND TOTAL AMOUNT.
II.
THE CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO CARRY OUT THE WORK AS PER WITH
THE RATES SHOWN IN THE SPECIFIC PRICE SCHEDULE OR SOME PERCENTAGE ABOVE
OR SOME PERCENTAGE BELOW THE RATE INDICATED IN THE SCHEDULE OF WORK
ATTACHED WITH THE TENDER.
III.
THE PERCENTAGE ABOVE OR BELOW OR AT PAR IS APPLICABLE ON THE OVERALL COST
OF THE WORK ALSO.
MERITS :
I.
THE RANKING AMONGST THE CONTRACTORS IS EASILY KNOWN JUST ON THE OPENING
OF THE TENDERS.
II.
AS THERE IS NO PROVISION TO QUOTE CONTRACTORS OWN RATE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL
ITEM, BENEFIT DUE TO INCREASED QUANTITY WITH A BENEFICIAL RATE CANNOT BE
AVAILED BY THE CONTRACTOR. THE CHANCE OF UNBALANCED TENDER GETS
ELIMINATED.
DEMERITS :
I.
A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ONLY THE PERCENTAGE ABOVE OR AT
PAR OR BELOW, IT IS VERY EASY TO WRITE SUCH A RATE IN FEW MINUTES BEFORE
THE TIME OF SUBMISSION OF THE TENDER.


2-25 C ()
II.
BY NEGOTIATING AMONG THE CONTRACTORS, TWO OR MORE MAY QUOTE THE SAME
RATE IN ORDER TO GET A PART OF THE WORK AT A HIGH RATE. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT
TO DIVIDE THE WORK AT EQUAL AMOUNT AMONG THE CONTRACTORS.
3.
LUMP-SUM CONTRACT :
I.
IN THIS TYPE OF CONTRACT, A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO QUOTE A FIXED SUM FOR
EXECUTION OF WORK COMPLETE IN ALL RESPECT IN THE STIPULATED TIME ACCORDING
TO THE DRAWING, DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS SUPPLIED TO HIM WITH THE TENDER.
II.
THE DEPARTMENTAL SCHEDULE OF RATE FOR VARIOUS ITEMS OF WORK IS ALSO
PROVIDED WHICH REGULATES THE PAYMENT OF THE CONTRACTOR IN RESPECT OF
ANY ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS WHICH ARE MADE OVER THE ORIGINAL WORK.
III.
ON THE COMPLETION OF THE WORK, NO DETAILED MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENT
ITEMS OF WORK IS NEEDED BUT THE WHOLE WORK DONE MUST BE COMPARED AND
CHECKED WITH THE DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
MERITS :
I.
AS THE TOTAL COST OF THE WORK KNOWN BEFORE HAND, THE OWNER CAN ARRANGE
THE FUND IN TIME.
II.
DETAILED MENSUREMENTS OF THE WORK DONE ARE NOT REQUIRED EXCEPT IN
RESPECT OF ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS.
III.
THE CONTRACTOR'S PROFIT MAINLY LIES IN THE COMPLETION TIME. HENCE FOR
GETTING MORE PROFIT THE CONTRACTOR TRIES TO COMPLETE THE WORK AS EARLY AS
POSSIBLE.
DEMERITS :
I.
IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL THAT THE WORK MUST BE DEFINED ACCURATELY, SPECIFICATIONS
MUST BE FULLY SPECIFIED AND THE SITE CONDITIONS MUST BE FULLY EXPLAINED
OTHERWISE DISPUTES CAN ARISE LATER ON.
II.
FOR ANY INTERMEDIATE PAYMENT, THE VALUE OF WORK DONE SHOULD NOT BE
LESS THAN THE PAYMENT BEING MADE.
4.
LABOUR CONTRACT :
I.
IN IABOUR CONTRACT, THE CONTRACTOR UNDERTAKES CONTRACT FOR THE INBOUR
PORTION ONLY EXCLUDING THE MATERIALS WHICH ARE ARRANGED AND SUPPLIED AT
THE WORK SITE BY THE DEPARTMENT/OWNER.
II.
THE CONTRACTOR ENGAGES THE REQUISITE LABOUR AND GETS THE WORK DONE AS
PER DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
III.
IT IS AN ITEM RATE BASIS FOR INBOUR PORTION ONLY AND THE CONTRACTOR IS PAID
FOR THE QUANTITIES OF WORK DONE ON MENSUREMENT OF DIFFERENT ITEMS OF
WORK AT THE STIPULATED RATE IN THE CONTRACT AGREEMENT.
MERITS :
I.
THE MATERIALS STORED BY THE DEPARTMENT ARE THUS UTILISED.
II.
THE WORK DONE THROUGH LABOUR CONTRACT IS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY AS BETTER
QUALITY MATERIALS ARE ARRANGED BY THE OWNER.
III. THE OVERALL COST OF CONSTRUCTION MAY BE LESS, AS NO PROFIT IS PAID ON THE
COST OF MATERIALS.

2-26 C ()
ANALYSIS OF RATES, SPECIFICATION AND TENDERS
IV.
THIS SYSTEM IS VERY CONVENIENT FOR PRIVATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION.
DEMERITS :
I.
A LARGE STORAGE AREA IS REQUIRED TO STORE THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MATERIALS TO
BE USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION UNDER A CONSTANT GUARDING.
II.
THIS SYSTEM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE OF
LENGTHY FORMALITIES IN PROCUREMENT OF MATERIALS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
SUPPLY EACH AND EVERY MATERIAL READILY TO THE LABOUR CONTRACTOR.
5.
COST PLUS PERCENTAGE RATE CONTRACT :
I.
IN THIS TYPE OF CONTRACT, A CONTRACTOR AGREES TO TAKE THE WORK OF
CONSTRUCTION ON THE ACTUAL COST OF WORK PLUS AN AGREED PERCENTAGE IN
ADDITION, FOR HIS SERVICES.
II.
IT IS GENERALLY ADOPTED WHEN THE LABOUR AND MATERIAL COSTS ARE LIABLE TO
FLUCTUATE HEAVILY IN THE MARKET.
III.
THE CONTRACTOR ARRANGES MATERIALS AND LABOUR AT HIS COST AND KEEPS
PROPER ACCOUNT WHICH IS PAID BY THE DEPARTMENT OR OWNER WITH CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE (SAY 10 %) OF THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION AS HIS PROFIT. AN
AGREEMENT IS MADE ACCORDINGLY IN ADVANCE.
MERITS :
I.
THE CONTRACT CAN BE QUICKLY DRAWN UP AND AGREED AND WORK CAN BE
COMPLETED IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.
II.
IT IS PARTICULARLY SUITABLE WHEN WORK CANNOT BE EXECUTED BY OTHER TYPES
OF CONTRACTS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET RATES OF
INBOUR AND MATERIALS.
DEMERITS :
I.
THE CONTRACTOR'S ONLY AIM IS TO MAKE THE COST OF THE PROJECT AS HIGH AS
POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SEEK GREATER MARGIN OF PROFIT.
�.
A PROPER CONTROL OVER PURCHASE OF MATERIALS AND OF LABOUR SHALL HAVE TO
BE EXERCISED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR THE OWNER.
QUE 2.21.
WRITE DOWN THE ELEMENTS OF TENDER PREPARATION.
10
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE ELEMENTS OF TENDER PREPARATION :
1.
AS PART OF THE PREPARATION WORK, AND BEFORE ANY TENDER IS ADVERTISED,
THE PROCURING AGENCY REQUIRES A REALISTIC ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF THE
STRUCTURE WITH A BREAKDOWN OF SIGNIFICANT COST ITEMS.
2.
TO PREPARE SUCH AN ESTIMATE, AN ENGINEER SHOULD BE SELECTED AND BE
APPOINTED TO NOT ONLY CARRY OUT THIS PRELIMINARY WORK BUT CONTINUE TO
SUPERVISE THE CONTRACTOR AND ENSURE ALL WORKS ARE CARRIED OUT ACCORDING
TO THE DESIGN AND TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY POSSIBLE.


2-27C ()
3.
THE PREPARATION OF TENDER AND CONTRACT DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ALL SURVEY
AND DESIGN WORK NEEDED TO PREPARE QUANTITIES AND GUIDELINE COSTINGS,
SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN GROD TIME.
4.
FFUNDS ARE TO BE SOURCED FROM INTERNATIONAL LENDING AGENCIES OR DONORS,
THEIR GUIDELINES WILL HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED AND EXAMPLES OF ADVERTISEMENTS
AND DOCUMENTS FROM SUCH ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE OBTAINED AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS.
5.
PREPARATION MAY REQUIRE THE APPLICATION FOR LAND AND WATER RIGHTS,
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS PLUS ANY NEEDED COMPENSATION OR
RESETTLEMENT PLANS.
6.
THESE MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE ANY CONSTRUCTION CAN BE APPROVED
AND ALLOWED TO PROCEED.

QUE 2.26. WHAT ARE RECIPROCAL PROMISES IN A CONTRACT ? HOW THEIR
NONFULFILLMENT TO BREACH OF CONTRACT 7 DISCUSS IT WITH A FEW PRACTICAL
EXAMPLES.
2014-13; 10


2-33 C ()
ANSWER
A.
RECIPROCAL PROMISES :
I
PROMISES WHICH FORM THE CONSIDERATION OR A PART OF CONSIDERATION FOR
EACH OTHER ARE CALLED RECIPROCAL PROMISES.
IL
AN ACREEMENT MAY CONSIST OF EITHER :
A
A PROMISE SUPPORTED BY CONSIDERATION GIVEN, OR
B.
A PROMISE SUPPORTED BY ANOTHER PROMISE.
EL
IN THE LATTER CASE. WHEN AN AGREEMENT IS SUPPORTED BY ANOTHER PROMISE,
IT WILL BE A RECIPROCAL PROMISE.
IV.
THUS, IN RECIPROCAL PROMISES EACH PARTY GIVES A PROMISE FOR A PROMISE.
RECIPROCAL PROMISES ARE OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES :
I.
MUTUAL AND INDEPENDENT RECIPROCAL PROMISES : WHEN EACH PARTY
PERFORMS HIS PROMISE INDEPENDENTLY AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FACT WHETHER
THE OTHER PARTY HAS PERFORMED. OR IS WILLING TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE OR
NOT. THE PROMISES ARE MUTUAL AND INDEPENDENT.
EXAMPLE : I AGREES Y TO SUPPLY MILK DAILY, WHILE Y AGREES TO PAY THE
PRICE OF MILK EVERY MONTH. BOTH THESE ARE MUTUAL AND INDEPENDENT
PROMISES.
II.
CONDITIONAL AND DEPENDENT RECIPROCAL PROMISES : WHEN THE
PERFORMANCE OF A PROMISE BY ONE PARTY DEPENDS UPON THE PRIOR PERMISSION
OF THE OTHER PARTY. IT WILL BE A CONDITIONAL AND DEPENDENT PROMISE.
EXAMPLE X PROMISES TO CONSTRUCT Y'S HOUSE, PROVIDED THAT Y SUPPLIES
CEMENT AND BRICKS. THIS WILL BE A CONDITIONAL AND DEPENDENT PROMISE.
HERE. X NEED NOT PERFORM THE PROMISE IF Y FAILS TO SUPPLY CEMENT AND
BRICKS.
III. MUTUAL AND CONCURRENT OR SIMULTANEOUS RECIPROCAL PROMISES:
THIS IS THE STATE WHEN TWO CONTRACTS ARE TO BE PERFORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY.
EXAMPLE : ALL CASH SALES ARE EXAMPLES OF SIMULTANEOUS OR CONCURRENT
PROMISES, AS DELIVERY OF GOODS AND PAYMENT OF PRICE TAKE PLACE
SIMULTANEOUSLY.
B. BREACH OF THE CONTRACT : BREACH IS NON-FULFILLMENT OF AN AGREED
PROMISE UNDER THE CONTRACT SUCH AS :
IL
NOT HANDING OVER THE ASSIGNMENT MENTIONED IN THE CONTRACT ON STIPULATED
TIMELINES.
IL
NOT FURNISHING THE RELEVANT DOCUMENT TO THE PROMISOR FOR MAKING THE
PAYMENT.
IL
NOT MAKING PAYMENTS ON TIME AS PER THE CONTRACT FOR WORK DONE.
IV.
NOT CONFIRMING TO THE SCHEDULE MENTIONED IN THE CONTRACT.
T.
NOT COMPLETING THE WORKS AS PER MILESTONES MENTIONED IN THE CONTRACT.
QUE 227.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF RETENTION MONEY ? WHEN
PAYMENTS MAY BE MADE AT REDUCED RATE ? HOW AND BY WHOM ARE THE
REDUCED RATES DETERMINED ?
2014-15; 10

2-34 C ()
ANALYSIS OF RATES, SPECIFICATION AND TENDERS
ANSWER
RETENTION MONEY : IT IS AN AMOUNT HELD BACK FROM A PAYMENT MADE
UNDER N CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT. IT IS USUALLY A PERCENTAGE (5%) OF THE
AMOUNT PAYABLE OF ENCH INSTALLMENT. IT IS GENERALLY HELD TO ENSURE THAT
N CONTRACTOR PERFORMS ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT, AND IS
THEN RELEASED EITHER ON PRACTICAL COMPLETION OR AFTER THE END OF A DEFECTS
NOTIFICATION PERIOD.
PURPOSE OF RETENTION MONEY :
1.
IN GENERAL, RETENTION MONEY PROVIDES PROTECTION TO THE EMPLOYER.
RETENTION MONEY GIVES THE IDEA OF IMPORTANCE OF COMPLETING THE SIGNED
PROJECT AS PER ITS TERMS AND DESIGNS.
2.
WITH SUCH RETENTION HELD, THE CONTRACTOR TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AS PER THE DESIGN AND QUALITY STATED IN
THE INITIAL CONTRACT.
CONDITION FOR REDUCED RATE : IF THE CONTRACTOR FAILS TO CARRY OUT THE
WORK STRICTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS, AND, IF
IN THE OPINION OF THE ENGINEER, THE WORK IS STRUCTURALLY SOUND, HE MAY
ACCEPT THE WORK, BUT THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE PAID AT REDUCED RATES WHICH
WILL BE DECIDED BY THE ENGINEER.
EXAMPLE : ASSUME THAT THE SPECIFICATION FOR TEAK WOOD PANELLED
WINDOWS AND DOORS MENTIONS THAT THE THICKNESS OF THE SHUTTERS SHOULD
BE 4 CM AND IF THE SHUTTERS ACTUALLY PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR ARE ONLY
3.5 CM THICK, THE ENGINEER MAY ACCEPT THE WORK AND REDUCE THE RATE PER
SQUARE METRE OF THE SHUTTERS BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REDUCTION IN THE
COST OF THE MATERIALS USED IN THE WORK.
QUE 2.28.

1.
EARNEST MONEY.
2. SECURITY DEPOSIT.
3.
MAINTENANCE LIABILITY PERIOD OF CONTRACT.
4.
DEBITABLE AGENCY.
5.
REGISTRATION OF CONTRAETORS AND SUPPLIERS BY ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENTS.
10
ANSWER
1.
EARNEST MONEY :
I.
EARNEST MONEY IS AN ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE ON THE PART OF THE CONTRACTOR
TO KEEP THE OFFER FOR CONSIDERATION AND TO CONFIRM HIS INTENTION TO TAKE
UP THE WORK IF ACCEPTED IN HIS FAVOUR FOR EXECUTION AS PER TERMS AND
CONDITIONS IN THE TENDER.
2
FOLLOWING ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF EARNEST MONEY :
I.
COMPENSATION : IN CASE, THE CONTRACTOR REFUSES TO TAKE UP THE WORK OR
RUNS AWAY WHEN HIS TENDER IS ACCEPTED, THE WORK CAN BE ALLOTTED TO THE
NEXT LOWEST BIDDER. THE EARNEST MONEY FORFEITED COMPENSATES THE LOSS
OF OWNER/DEPARTMENT TO A GREAT EXTENT.


2-35 C ()
IL. PUNISHMENT : IN CASE THE CONTRACTOR QUOTES LOWER RATE WITHOUT INTENTION
OF DOING THE WORK THE EARNEST MONEY SHALL BE FORFEITED AS A PUNISHMENT
ILL. RESTRICTION ON UNNECESSARY COMPETITION : THE PROVISION OF EARNEST
MONEY WILL RESTRICT THE ENTRY OF MANY CONTRACTORS WHO MAY NOT HAVE
ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO THE WORK.
2 SECURITY DEPOSIT :
L
THE CONTRACTOR WHOSE TENDER HAS BEEN ACCEPTED IS TO DEPOSIT 10% OF THE
TEADERED AMOUNT AS SECURITY MONEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT INCLUSIVE OF
THE EARNEST MONEY ALREADY DEPOSITED.
E
THIS AMOUNT IS KEPT AS A CHECK SO THAT THE CONTRACTOR FULFILS ALL THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS AND CARRIES OUT THE WORK SATISFACTORILY WITHIN THE
PRESCRIBED TIME LIMIT
IL
IF THE CONTRACTOR FAILS ON THIS PART, HIS WHOLE OR PART OF THE SECURITY
MONEY IS FORFEITED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS A PUNISHMENT.
IS.
THE SECURITY MONEY ALSO SERVES AS A SECURITY AGAINST THE MATERIALS OR
THE TOOLS AND MACHINERIES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO THE CONTRACTOR
ON LOAN
S MAINTENANCE LIABILITY PERIOD OF CONTRACT :
IL
THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD IS THE PERIOD FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF A
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DURING WHICH THE CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN
ISSUES UNDER THE MANY BUILDING OR ENGINEERING CONTRACTS.
IN
DURING THIS PERIOD. THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE IN FORCE,
THE EXTENT OF WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTRACT AND ON HIS OWN CONCERN
FOR THE RISK BE IS FACING.
IL
NORMALLY THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD WILL LAST FOR TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE
COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT BUT THIS MAY BE LONGER OR SHORTER.
4
DEBITABLE AGENCY = WHEN THE CONTRACTOR FAILS TO FULFILL HIS CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF PROGRESS OR QUALITY OF WORK EVEN AFTER BEING
GIVEN DUE NOTICE BY THE OWNER. A DEBITABLE AGENCY IS APPOINTED. THE
EXPENSES INCURRED WILL BE CHARGED FROM THE BILLS OF CONTRACTOR OR SECURITY
MONEY DEPOSITED EARLIER.
5.
REGISTRATION OF CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BY ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENTS
:
IL
THE CONTRACTOR AND SUPPLIERS MUST GET HIMSELF REGISTERED IN THE
DEPARTMENTS (OR GOVERNMENT) FOR WHICH HE IS INTERESTED TO TAKE UP
WORKS.
=
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS ARE ENTITLED TO DO GOVERNMENT JOBS IF AWARDED.
CONTRACTORS ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE REGISTRATION AND REGISTRATION
FEES AND DEPENDING ON THIS THEY CAN UNDERTAKE WORKS UP TO CERTAIN
AMOUNT

WHAT ARE THE SIX MAIN FUNCTIONS OF MANAGEMENT IN
UNDERTAKING A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ? DISCUSS.
2014-15; 10


3-7C ()
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE SIX MAIN FUNCTIONS OF MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION
PROJECT :
1.
PLANNING :
I.
THE FIRST MANAGERIAL FUNCTION INVOLVES PLANNING. THE FUNCTION IS ABOUT
CREATING A DETAILED PLAN TOWARDS ACHIEVING A SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL
OBJECTIVE.
IL
WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING, YOU ARE IDENTIFYING THE TASKS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED
TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED GOALS, OUTLINING HOW THE TASKS SHOULD BE PERFORMED,
AND IDENTIFYING WHEN AND BY WHOM THEY MUST BE PERFORMED.
NI
THE FOCUS OF PLANNING IS ABOUT ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES AND IT DOES REQUIRE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S OBJECTIVES AND VISION.
2
ORGANIZING :
I.
THE NEXT FUNCTION OF MANAGEMENT FOLLOWS PLANNING AND IT IS ABOUT
ORGANIZING. IT'S ABOUT USING THE PLAN TO BRING TOGETHER THE PHYSICAL,
FINANCIAL AND OTHER AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND USE THEM TO ACHIEVE THE
ORGANIZATIONAL GOAL.
NI.
IT INVOLVES A CERTAIN PATTERN OF RELATIONSHIP OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
AMONG THE MEMBERS OF GROUPS, SO THAT THE WORK IS PERFORMED WITH
SPEED, ACCURACY AND ECONOMY TO ACHIEVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES.
3.
STAFFING:
I.
STAFFING IS A PROCESS OF MATCHING THE JOBS WITH INDIVIDUALS.
IL.
AFTER ORGANIZING THE TOTAL ACTIVITIES TO BE DONE, MANAGEMENT IS IN A
POSITION TO KNOW MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY AT DIFFERENT
LEVEL IN THE ORGANIZATION.
III.
MANAGEMENT IS TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS FOR RECRUITMENT, SELECTION,
TRAINING AND PLACEMENT OF EMPLOYEES.
IV. STAFFING IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS BECAUSE EXISTING EMPLOYEES MAY LEAVE
THE ORGANIZATION AND THE NEW EMPLOYEES MAY JOIN IT.
4.
DIRECTING :
I.
MANAGEMENT IS, ESSENTIALLY, AN ART OF GETTING THE WORK DONE WITH THE
PEOPLE. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF
PLANNING AND ORGANIZING THE OPERATIONS BUT ALSO OF GUIDING AND DIRECTING
THE SUBORDINATES TOWARDS THE COMMON GOAL OF THE ENTERPRISE.
II.
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS PERFORMED
BY MANAGERS/SUPERVISORS AT ALL THE LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION.
III.
WHEN ANY DECISION IS TAKEN, IT MUST BE CONVERTED INTO ACTION AND FOR
CONVERTING INTO ACTION, DIRECTION IS REQUIRED.
5.
CO-ORDINATING :
I.
THE PROCESS OF CO-ORDINATION INVOLVES SYNCHRONIZING INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS
WITH THE GOALS OF THE ENTERPRISE.
-

3-8 C ()
ELEMENTS OF MANAGEMENT
II.
CO-ORDINATION IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ACHIEVING HARMONY OF INDIVIDUAL
ACTIONS TOWARDS ACCOMPLISHMENT OF COMPANY OBJECTIVES.
III.
INEFFECTIVE CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF A BUSINESS
ENTERPRISE (SUCH AS PRODUCTION, SALE, ADMINISTRATION ETC.) CAN RUN THE
ENTERPRISE.
6.
CONTROLLING :
I.
CONTROL CONSISTS IN VERIFYING WHETHER EVERYTHING OCCURS IN CONFORMITY
WITH THE PLANS ADOPTED, THE INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED AND PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED.
II.
IT HAS TO POINT OUT WEAKNESSES AND ERRORS IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THEM AND
PREVENT RECURRENCE.
III.
IT OPERATES ON BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN RESOURCES. CHECKS AND
EXAMINATIONS ARE REQUIRED ON A PERIODIC BASIS TO ENSURE THAT ORDERS ARE
NOT MISUNDERSTOOD, RULES ARE NOT VIOLATED AND OBJECTIVES HAVE NOT BEEN
UNKNOWINGLY SHIFTED OR LOST SIGHT OF IT.
IV.
THE CONTROL FUNCTION FOLLOWS THE THREE BASIC STEPS :
A.
ESTABLISHING STANDARDS,
B.
APPRAISING PERFORMANCE, AND
C.
TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.
QUE 3.5.
DESCRIBE THE SALIENT FEATURES OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES INVOLVED TO BE PLANNED FOR A NEW PROJECT. WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF PLANNING TECHNIQUES TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR A NEW PROJECT ?
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE ACTIVITIES INVOLVED IN CONSTRUCTION PLANNING :
1.
DEFINING THE SCOPE OF WORK : SINCE ALL ACTIVITIES INVOLVE CONSUMPTION
OF DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO DIFFERENT EXTENTS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE SCOPE
OF WORK INVOLVED IS PROPERLY AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, COMPLETELY
DEFINED.
2.
IDENTIFYING ACTIVITIES INVOLVED :
I.
THIS PART OF PLANNING IS VERY CLOSELY LINKED TO DEFINING THE SCOPE. AND
INVOLVES IDENTIFYING ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR JOB.
II.
SINCE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES INVOLVED CONSUME DIFFERENT PHYSICAL RESOURCES
TO VARYING EXTENTS, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE EXHAUSTIVELY
LISTED, ALONG WITH THE RESOURCES REQUIRED.
3.
ESTABLISHING PROJECT DURATION :
I.
THIS CAN BE DONE ONLY WITH A CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF THE REQUIRED RESOURCES,
PRODUCTIVITIES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS.
II.
THIS INFORMATION IS USED TO PREPARE A NETWORK AND OTHER FORMS OF
REPRESENTATIONS OUTLINING THE SCHEDULES.


3-9 C ()
4.
DEFINING PROCEDURES FOR CONTROLLING AND ASSIGNING RESOURCES :
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PLANNING DOCUMENT PREPARED IS FOLLOWED BY
OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT, OR IN ITS INDIVIDUAL PHASES.
THUS, THE PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR PROCUREMENT AND CONTROL OF
RESOURCES FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES-MANPOWER, MACHINES, MATERIAL AND
MONEY-ARE ALSO LAID DOWN.
5.
DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE INTERFACES : THE PLANNER NEEDS TO DEVISE AN
APPROPRIATE SYSTEM FOR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) REPORTING.
TOOLS SUCH AS COMPUTERS AND FORMATS FOR REPORTING ARE WIDELY USED, AND
IT MAY BE NOTED THAT SEVERAL SOFTWARE ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO AID THE
PLANNER
6.
UPDATING AND REVISING PLANS : ALTHOUGH A CONSTRUCTION PLAN NEEDS
TO BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED AND REVISED DURING MONITORING, SOME BASIC
ISSUES SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND BEFORE DRAWING UP A FULL-FLEDGED PLAN.
ROLES OF PLANNING : FOLLOWING ARE THE ROLES OF PLANNING IN DEVELOPING
A NEW PROJECT.
1.
MINIMIZES UNCERTAINTY : PLANNING HELPS IN MINIMIZING THE
UNCERTAINTIES OF THE FUTURE AS IT ANTICIPATES FUTURE EVENTS.
2
EMPHASIS ON OBJECTIVES : WHEN THE OBJECTIVES ARE CLEARLY FIXED, THE
EXECUTION OF PLANS WILL BE FACILITATED TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES.
3.
PROMOTES COORDINATION : PLANNING HELPS TO PROMOTE THE COORDINATED
EFFORT ON ACCOUNT OF PRE-DETERMINED GOALS.
4.
FACILITATES CONTROL : PLANNING AND CONTROL ARE INSEPARABLE IN THE
SENSE THAT UNPLANNED ACTIONS CANNOT BE CONTROLLED. CONTROL IS NOTHING
BUT MAKING SURE THAT ACTIVITIES CONFORM TO THE PLANS.
5.
IMPROVES COMPETITIVE STRENGTH : PLANNING ENABLES AN ENTERPRISE TO
DISCOVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH GIVE IT A COMPETITIVE EDGE.
6.
ECONOMICAL OPERATION : PLANNING HELPS IN PROPER UTILIZATION OF
RESOURCES AND ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY ACTIVITIES.
7.
ENCOURAGES INNOVATION : PLANNING CREATES AN INNOVATIVE AND
FORESIGHTED ATTITUDE AMONG THE MANAGERS.
QUE 3.6.
EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLES OF PLANNING. STATE THEIR
ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS.
10
ANSWER
PRINCIPLES OF PLANNING : FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS PRINCIPLES OF
PLANNING :
1.
CONTRIBUTION TO OBJECTIVES: :
I.
THE PLANS ARE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING THE ORGANIZATIONAL
GOALS.

3-10 C ()
ELEMENTS OF MANAGEMENT
II.
IN THIS WAY, BOTH THE MAJOR AS WELL AS THE DERIVATIVE PLANS ARE MADE WITH
A VIEW TO CONTRIBUTE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS.
2.
PRIMACY OF PLANNING :
I.
ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THE PROCESS OF PLANNING IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTION
OF ALL THE MANAGERS.
II.
THE MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED TO PLAN ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND THEN THEY SHOULD
PROCEED WITH OTHER FUNCTIONS.
3.
PLANNING PREMISES : FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE PROCESS OF PLANNING
EFFECTIVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS OR PREMISES THAT HAVE TO BE
MADE AND THE PLANNING IS UNDERTAKEN ON THE BASIS OF THESE PREMISES.
4.
PRINCIPLE OF ALTERNATIVES : THE PROCESS OF PLANNING INVOLVES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES AND THEN THE PLANNERS SELECT THE
ALTERNATIVE THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR ACHIEVING THE ORGANIZATIONAL
GOALS.
5.
PRINCIPLE OF TIMING : THE PLANS HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF CONTRIBUTING
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS IF THE PLANS
ARE PROPERLY TIMED. THEREFORE THE PLANNING PREMISES AS WELL AS THE
POLICIES ARE NOT MUCH HELPFUL IF THE PLANS ARE NOT PROPERLY TIMED.
6.
PRINCIPLE OF FLEXIBILITY :
I.
ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THERE SHOULD BE FLEXIBILITY IN THE PLANS. THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS THE PLANS TO DEAL WITH THE
CONTINGENCIES THAT MAY DEVELOP LATER ON.
II.
THEREFORE, THE PLANS SHOULD BE ADJUSTABLE SO THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE
CHANGES THAT MAY DEVELOP AFTER THE PLANS HAVE BEEN FORMULATED.
7.
PRINCIPLE OF COMPARATIVE STRATEGIES :
I.
THIS REQUIRES THAT WHILE FORMULATING THEIR PLANS, THE MANAGERS SHOULD
ALSO CONSIDER THE PLANS MADE BY THEIR COMPETITORS.
II.
IN THIS WAY, THE MANAGERS SHOULD FORMULATE THEIR PLANS BY CONSIDERING
WHAT THE COMPETITION WOULD HAVE DONE IN SUCH A CASE.
8.
PRINCIPLE OF COMMITMENT : ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, A TIME FRAME
SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE PLAN DURING WHICH THE CONUMITMENTS MADE IN
THE PLAN HAVE TO BE FULFILLED. THIS COMMITMENT ALLOWS THE MANAGERS TO
ACHIEVE THE TARGETS IN TIME.
ADVANTAGES OF PLANNING : FOLLOWING ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF PLANNING :
1.
PLANNING HELPS IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTIVES OF AN ENTERPRISE.
2.
PLANNING AVOIDS CHAOS BECAUSE ALL EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS
A
PREDETERMINED GOALS OF THE ENTERPRISE.
3.
PLANNING HELPS IN CONTROL BY DISTRIBUTING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIFFERENT
PERSONS AND JOBS.
4.
PLANNING MINIMIZOS THE COST BY UTILIZING THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN THE
BOST WAY.


3-11 C ()
LIMITATIONS OF PLANNING : FOLLOWING ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF PLANNING
1.
IN CASE THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE MANAGERS IS NOT RELIABLE,
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON THIS DATA CAN ALSO BE
UNRELIABLE.
2.
IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE NOTED THAT THE PROCESS OF PLANNING CAN BE VERY
EXPENSIVE.
3.
THE PROCESS OF PLANNING CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING AND THIS IN TURN
REDUCES THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF PLANNING.
4.
PLANNING CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REMEDY FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS FACED BY
THE ORGANIZATION.

BASIS FOR SHORT LEAD AND CYCLE TIME MATERIALS, MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE
FOR LONGER LEAD TIME ITEMS AND ON REPLENISHMENT BASIS FOR IMPORTED
ITEMS WITH LONG LEAD/CYCLE TIME.
2.
LABOUR SCHEDULING :
I.
IT IS USED TO CREATE, UPDATE, AND REVIEW EMPLOYEE LABOUR SCHEDULES. A
LABOUR SCHEDULE SPECIFIES HOW AN EMPLOYEE'S PAY IS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO
ORACLE GRANTS ACCOUNTING, ORACLE PROJECTS, OR ORACLE GENERAL LEDGER.
II.
MULTIPLE LABOUR SCHEDULES CAN BE CREATED FOR EACH EMPLOYEE ASSIGNMENT.
III.
EACH SCHEDULE CONTAINS SCHEDULE LINES WITH CHARGING INSTRUCTIONS FOR
GRANTS ACCOUNTING, PROJECTS, OR GENERAL LEDGER.
IV.
EACH PAYROLL IS DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE LINES IN EFFECT FOR
THE PERIOD OF THE PAYROLL TO BE DISTRIBUTED. AN EMPLOYEE CAN HAVE AN
UNLIMITED NUMBER OF SCHEDULE LINES.
3.
EQUIPMENT SCHEDULING :
I.
A CIVIL ENGINEERING PROJECT NEEDS A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENTS AND IT IS
IMPERATIVE FOR THE ENGINEER/CONTRACTOR TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENTS
AND WHAT NUMBER OF THE EQUIPMENT AND FOR HOW MANY DAYS (WITH EXACT
DATES) FOR EACH WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE PURPOSE.
II.
SO THAT HE MAY ARRANGE THEM TIMELY BY HIRING OR BY PURCHASING OR BY
ANY OTHER MEANS AND THE WORK MAY NOT BE DELAYED BECAUSE OF NON-
AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT.

3-12 C ()
ELEMENTS OF MANAGEMENT
4.
FINANCIAL SCHEDULING :
I.
IT CONTAINED IN AN AUDITED ANNUAL REPORT, SUMMARIZES THE AUDITED FINANCIAL
POSITION OF THE AUDITED ENTITY.
II.
OTHER APPLICATION OF THE TERM IS THE SCHEDULING OF AMOUNTS, NOT
NECESSARILY BY DATE, OF MAJOR FINANCIAL EVENTS BY ANY GIVEN CATEGORY AS TO
PROJECTED RECEIPTS, PAYMENTS, COSTS, ETC.

PROJECT PLANNING IS CONCERNED WITH LAYING DOWN CERTAIN OBJECTIVES, GOAL
AND STRATEGIES. BETTER RESULTS CAN BE ACHIEVED IF THE DESIGN OF THE
PROJECT WORK IS SYSTEMATIZED.
2
PROJECT INFORMATION SYSTEM :
I
IN ORGANIZING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT WORK, THE INFORMATION
SYSTEM MUST BE GOOD.
II
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SOME ORGANIZATIONS HAVE IS THAT THE
DATA ON PROJECT STATUS IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISTRIBUTED AT SUCH
LARGE TIME INTERVALS SO AS TO MAKE THE INFORMATION USELESS IN TERMS OF
CONTROL.
3
PROJECT CONTROL SYSTEM :
I
MONITORING AND CONTROL ARE THE IMPORTANT SUB-SETS OF THE PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF MONITORING IS TO SEE DEVIATIONS
FROM THE PLANNED PROJECT PERFORMANCE.

A SYSTEM APPROACH WILL ENABLE THE PROJECT MANAGER TO REDUCE THE RISK
WHICH IS INHERENT IN MOST PROJECTS.
II
AN ORGANIZATION IS OFTEN NEEDED BY THE PROJECT MANZGER FOR SECURING
CO-ORDINATED EFFORTS OF ALL PARTICIPANTS. THIS ORGANIZATION MUST DEFINE
THE LIMITS OF AUTHORITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS.
6.
CULTURAL SYSTEM :
I.
THE PROJECT ORGANIZATION OPERATES IN A GIVEN CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT.
II.
THE CULTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION IS THE TOTALITY OF THE VALUES, TRADITIONS,
BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOURS OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROJECT ORGANIZATION,
SINCE, CHANGE IS RESISTED, IT MUST BE PROPERLY PLANNED TO AVOID TROUBLES.
7.
HUMAN SYSTEM :
I.
HUMAN RESOURCES SYSTEM IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE PROJECT
MANAGEMENT.
II.
PROJECT TECHNIQUES AND METHODOLOGIES ARE OF NO USE IF PERSONNEL LACK
ADEQUATE SKILLS AND MOTIVATION.
III.
A PROJECT MANAGER NEEDS VERY GOOD INTERPERSONAL SKILLS. THESE INCLUDE
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE GOOD LEADERSHIP FOR PROJECT TEAM. THE ABILITY TO
DEAL WITH OTHER CONSTITUENTS FOR NEEDED RESOURCES, SKILLS IN MOTIVATING
TEAM MEMBERS, GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS ETC.

NETWORK RULES : FOLLOWING ARE THE RULES USED FOR PREPARE A NETWORK:
1.
IN A NETWORK, THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF EVENTS :
I
INITIAL EVENT,
IL
FINAL EVENT, AND
II.
DUAL ROLE EVENT.
2
THE COMPLETION OF A PROJECT, WHICH CONSTITUTES OF A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES,
PASSES THROUGH A NUMBER OF EVENTS. THESE EVENTS MUST OCCUR AT DEFINITE
TIME AND IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE OR ORDER. AS PER SEQUENCE OR ORDER THE
EVENTS MAY BE SPECIFIED AS PREDECESSOR EVENTS AND SUCCESSOR EVENTS.
3.
SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN EVENT, ACTIVITY ALSO MAY BE PREDECESSOR ACTIVITY AND
SUCCESSOR ACTIVITY.
4.
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO ASSUME THAT TIME FLOWS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHICH GIVES
THE DIRECTION OF ARROWS.
5.
ARROWS SHOULD NORMALLY NOT CROSS EACH OTHER.
6.
IT IS ESSENTIAL TO NUMBER THE EVENTS IN A DISCRETE MANNER. EVERY ACTIVITY
IN A NETWORK IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS OWN I-NODE AND J-NODE NUMBER.
FULKERSON'S RULE OF NODE NUMBERING :
I
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE INITIAL EVENT IN A NETWORK WHICH HAS ONLY ARROWS
COMING OUT OF IT. THE EVENT IS FIRST GIVEN NUMBER (SAY 1).
II.
ALL THE ARROWS COMING OUT OF EVENT (1) ARE NEGLECTED. THIS PROVIDES US
WITH ONE OR MORE INITIAL EVENTS. THESE EVENTS ARE NUMBERED AS (2), (3),
(4), ETC.
III.
AGAIN. NEGLECT ALL ARROWS COMING OUT OF THESE EVENTS. A FEW MORE INITIAL
EVENTS WILL BE CREATED, NUMBER THEM SIMILARLY.
IV.
THIS OPERATION IS CONTINUED UNTIL THE LAST EVENT IS REACHED AND NUMBERED.

WITHIN WHICH AN EVENT TIME CAN VARY.
SLACK = T1 - TE
SLACK MAY BE POSITIVE, ZERO OR NEGATIVE DEPENDING UPON THE VALUE OF TG
AND TI OF THAT EVENT.
I
POSITIVE SLACK : WHEN T2 IS MORE THAN TE POSITIVE SLACK IS OBTAINED.
IT INDICATES THE PROJECT IS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE MEANING THEREBY THE EXCESS
RESOURCES.
II. ZERO SLACK: WHEN II IS EQUAL TO TE ZERO SLACK IS OBTAINED. IT INDICATES
THAT THE PROJECT IS GOING ON SCHEDULE MEANING THEREBY ADEQUATE
RESOURCES.
III. NEGATIVE SLACK : WHEN THE SCHEDULE COMPLETION TIME TS (AND HENCE
T2) IS LESS THAN TB NEGATIVE SLACK IS OBTAINED. IT INDICATES THE PROJECT IS
BEHIND SCHEDULE MEANING THEREBY THE LACK OF RESOURCES.

WHAT IS RESOURCE ALLOCATION ? HOW IS IT ACHIEVED THROUGH NETWORK TECHNIQUES ?
ANSWER
RESOURCES ALLOCATION :
I
RESOURCE ALLOCATION SIMPLY MEANS DECIDING WHAT RESOURCES EACH ACTIVITY
OF THE PROJECT REQUIRES. FOR THIS RESOURCE USAGE PROFILE I.E., HISTOGRAM IS
DRAWN EITHER ON EARLIEST START OF EACH ACTIVITY OR LATEST START OF EACH
ACTIVITY BASIS.
IL
THE PROCESS OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF FITTING ACTIVITIES
INTO PATTERN OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY WITHIN STIPULATED TIME PERIOD AND IT
IS ACHIEVED BY THE FOLLOWING WAYS, NAMELY.
1.
RESOURCE SMOOTHING : IN THIS APPROACH THE TOTAL PROJECT DURATION IS
NOT CHANGED BUT SOME OF THE ACTIVITY START TIMES ARE SHIFTED BY THEIR
AVAILABLE FLOAT SO THAT MORE OR LESS UNIFORM DEMAND IS GENERATED AND
THIS IS CALLED RESOURCE SMOOTHING.
EXAMPLE :
I.
THE PROJECT DURATION (6 DAYS) IS MAINTAINED, SO THE CRITICAL ACTIVITY
(10 - 40) WILL START EARLIEST AND FINISH IN 6 DAYS.
IL
BUT THE PATH (10-20-40) - - HAS 3 DAYS FLOAT AND PATH (10 - 30 40) HAS 2
DAYS FLOAT.
NI.
THE FLOAT PERIOD MAY BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE ACTIVITIES LYING ON THE
PATH OR THE FLOAT MAY BE DISTRIBUTED OVER ONE ACTIVITY ON THE PATH.

IV. VARIOUS TRIALS AND ERRORS ARE TAKEN AND FINALLY THE RESOURCE SMOOTHING
IS OBTAINED AND IS PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF HISTOGRAM AND THE
CORRESPONDING NETWORK SHOWING START TIME OF EACH ACTIVITY.
2.
RESOURCE LEVELLING :
IN THIS APPROACH, THE ACTIVITY START TIMES ARE SO RESCHEDULED THAT THE
PEAK DEMAND DOES NOT EXCEED THE AVAILABLE LIMIT OF RESOURCE. IF IT DOES
NOT GIVE THE DESIRABLE RESULT BY CONSIDERATION OF FLOATS, THE TOTAL PROJECT

3-38 C ()
ELEMENTS OF MANAGEMENT
DURATION TO MINIMUM EXTENT MAY BE EXTENDED AND THIS IS CALLED RESOURCE
LEVELLING.
EXAMPLE :
I.
IF THE RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IS QUITE LIMITED. IT CANNOT MEET PERIOD BY
PERIOD VARIATION.
II.
CRITICAL ACTIVITY (10 - 40) IS GIVEN ONE DAY FLOAT IN THE START TIME MAKING
PROJECT PERIOD OF 7 DAYS INSTEAD OF 6 DAYS.
III.
FLOAT OF 4 DAYS IN THE PATH OF (10 - 20 40) HAS BEEN TOTALLY USED IN THE
ACTIVITY OF (20 - 40) ONLY SUCH THAT THE ACTIVITY STARTS 2 DAYS LATE AND
FINISHES 2 DAYS EARLIER.
IV. 3 DAYS FLOAT OF THE PATH (10 - 30 - 40) HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED SUCH THAT
ACTIVITY (10 - 30) STARTS 1 DAY LATE AND ACTIVITY (30-40) - STARTS 2 DAYS LATE.

PRODUCTIVITY INDEX = PRODUCTIVITY DURING CURRENT YEAR
PRODUCTIVITY DURING BASE YEAR
PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES : FOLLOWING ARE THREE METHODS :
I.
PARTIAL PRODUCTIVITY,
II.
TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY, AND
ILL
TOTAL PRODUCTIVITY.
COST OF OWNING AND OPERATING : THE COST OF POSSESSION OF AN
EQUIPMENT IS CALLED COST OF OWNING TO WHICH CAN BE ADDED THE
COST OF FUEL FOR RUNNING THE EQUIPMENT. IT IS GENERALLY ESTIMATED
ON HOURLY BASIS. THUS IT IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EQUIPMENT
SHOULD BE HIRED. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LABOUR COST.
CONSTITUENTS OF THE COST OF OWNING AND OPERATING :

DEFINE PRODUCTIVITY. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT METHODS TO
?


4-3 C ()
ANSWER
PRODUCTIVITY : A PRODUCTIVITY MEASURE IS EXPRESSED AS THE RATIO OF
OUTPUT TO INPUT USED IN A PRODUCTION PROCESS, I.E., OUTPUT PER UNIT OF
INPUT.
OUTPUT
PRODUCTIVITY =
INPUT
METHODS : FOLLOWING ARE THE METHODS TO MEASURE THE PRODUCTIVITY :
1.
PARTIAL PRODUCTIVITY : IT IS THE RATIO OF OUTPUT TO ONE CLASS OF INPUT
AMONG MANY FACTORS OF PRODUCTION.
OUTPUT
I.
LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY =
LABOUR INPUT
OUTPUT
II.
CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY =
CAPITAL EMPLOYED
OUTPUT
III.
MATERIAL PRODUCTIVITY =
MATERIAL INPUT
2.
TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY : IT IS THE RATIO OF NET OUTPUT TO THE SUM OF
ASSOCIATED LABOUR AND CAPITAL (FACTOR) INPUTS. NET OUTPUT MEANS OUTPUT
MINUS MATERIAL, CAPITAL, ENERGY AND OTHER INPUT EXPENSES.
NET OUTPUT
TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY =
LABOUR INPUTS + CAPITAL INPUTS
3.
TOTAL PRODUCTIVITY : IT IS THE RATIO OF TOTAL OUTPUT TO THE SUM OF ALL INPUT
FACTORS. IT REPRESENTS THE JOINT IMPACT OF ALL THE INPUT FACTORS IN PRODUCING
THE OUTPUT.
TOTAL TANGIBLE (MEASURABLE) OUTPUT
TOTAL PRODUCTIVITY
=
TOTAL TANGIBLE INPUT
TOTAL TANGIBLE OUTPUT = VALUE OF FINISHED PRODUCT + VALUE OF PARTIALLY
FINISHED UNIT + DIVIDENDS FROM SECURITIES + INTEREST + OTHER INCOME.
TOTAL TANGIBLE INPUT = VALUE OF HUMAN, MATERIAL, CAPITAL, ENERGY AND
OTHER INPUTS USED.
QUE 4.2.
DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING THE PRODUCTIVITY.
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING THE PRODUCTIVITY :
1.
VALUE ANALYSIS : THIS IS SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION OF THE PROJECT TO REDUCE
COST AND IMPROVE VALUE. IT REDUCES EXCESS WORK CONTENT.

4-4 ()
EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT
2
PROCESS PLANNING AND RESEARCH : PROCESS PLANNING ENSURES SELECTION
OF CURRENT MACHINES. PROCESS RESEARCH ENSURES CORRECT OPERATION.
3. METHOD STUDY: : IT IS A TECHNIQUE TO SIMPLIFY THE JOB AND DEVELOP MORE
ECONOMICAL METHODS OF DOING IT.
4.
WORK MEASUREMENT : THE STANDARD TIME FOR COMPLETING A JOB IS SET BY
THE USE OF WORK MEASUREMENT.
5.
WORKER TRAINING : THROUGH SOUND AND UNIFORM TRAINING, WORKING
METHODS CAN BE ENSURED.
6.
PROJECT PLANNING AND CONTROL : IT REDUCES IDLE TIME OF MEN AND
MACHINES.
7.
MATERIAL CONTROL : IRREGULAR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS MAY CAUSE IDLE TIME
OF MEN AND MACHINES. IT REDUCES OR AVOIDS LOCKING UP CAPITAL AND REDUCES
PROJECT COST.
&
EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE : PROPER MAINTENANCE REDUCES IDLE TIME OF
MEN AND MACHINES DUE TO BREAKDOWNS.
9.
IMPROVED WORKING CONDITION : IT ENABLES THE WORKERS TO WORK
EFFICIENTLY TO RAISE PRODUCTIVITY.
10. PERSONAL POLICY : IT CREATES A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MANAGEMENT
AND EMPLOYEES AND REDUCES INEFFECTIVE TIME.
11. INCENTIVES : IT AROUSES INTEREST IN AN EMPLOYEE TO PRODUCE MORE.
QUE 4.3.
WHAT IS OWNING AND OPERATIONAL COST OF ANY EQUIPMENT ?
WHY IS IT NECESSARY FOR PROJECT ? ALSO GIVE THE AFFECTING FACTOR OF IT.
ANSWER
1. THE COST OF POSSESSION OF AN EQUIPMENT IS CALLED COST OF OWNING TO WHICH
CAN BE ADDED THE COST OF FUEL FOR RUNNING THE EQUIPMENT. IT IS GENERALLY
ESTIMATED ON HOURLY BASIS.
2.
THIS IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE HIRED. IT DOES NOT
INCLUDE THE LABOUR COST.
NECESSITY : IN CASES WHERE THE MACHINE AND THE ELEMENTS OF PRODUCTION
ARE NOT RENTED, A CALCULATION OF THE OWNING AND OPERATING COSTS IS
NECESSARY TO DERIVE THE MACHINE RATE.
FACTOR : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS AFFECT THE COST OF OWNING AND
OPERATING :
1.
INITIAL COST OF THE EQUIPMENT WHICH CONSISTS THE PRICE OF EQUIPMENT,
TRANSPORTATION COST, LOADING AND UNLOADING CHARGE AND INSTALLATION
COST.
2.
SEVERITY OF SERVICE CONDITION UNDER WHICH IT IS TO BE USED.
3.
NUMBER OF HOURS IT IS USED PER YEAR.
4.
THE CARE WITH WHICH IT IS MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED.


4-5 C ()
5.
THE DEMAND FOR EQUIPMENT AFTER ITS USEFUL PERIOD IE., THE SALVAGE
VALUE.
6.
USEFUL LIFE OF EQUIPMENT IN YEARS.
QUE 4.4.
HOW WILL YOU MAINTAIN THE COST RECORDS OF THE
EQUIPMENTS ?
ANSWER
1.
DEPRECIATION AND REPLACEMENT COST :
I.
FOR CONSIDERATION OF REPLACEMENT COST OF THE EQUIPMENT, IT IS NECESSARY
TO KNOW THE SALVAGE VALUE OF THE SIMILAR EQUIPMENT FOR EACH YEAR OF ITS
LIFE SEPARATELY.
II.
SINCE THE AVERAGE COST OF THE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN INCREASING
AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5 % PER YEAR DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS.
III.
SO, THE REPLACEMENT COST MUST BE INCREASED 5 % PER YEAR TO ACCOMMODATE
THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF EQUIPMENT.
2.
INVESTMENT COST : THE INVESTMENT COST IS ASSUMED TO BE 10 TO 12 % PER
YEAR OF THE VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.
3.
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR COST
:
I.
THE COST OF MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR COST LARGELY VARIES WITH THE CONDITION
UNDER WHICH THE EQUIPMENT IS USED AND THE CARE WITH WHICH IT IS HANDLED.
II.
SO, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP ACCURATE RECORDS OF THESE COSTS.
4.
DOWNTIME COST :
I.
DOWNTIME IS THE TIME WHICH IS LOST WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS UNDERGOING
REPAIRS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
II.
IT INCREASES WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME. IF AN EQUIPMENT IS DOWN 5 PERCENT
OF TIME, ITS AVAILABILITY FOR ACTUAL PRODUCTION IS 95 PERCENT OF WORKING
HOURS.
III.
SUPPOSING THE OPERATING COST IS RS. 5.00 PER HOUR WITH AN AVERAGE
DOWNTIME OF 5%.
IV. THE COST PER HOUR FOR THIS DOWNTIME WILL BE 0.05 X 5 = RS. 0.25 AND IF THE
MACHINE IS USED 2000 HOURS PER YEAR, THE ANNUAL COST OF DOWNTIME WILL
BE 2000 X RS. 0.25 = RS. 500.
5.
OBSOLESCENCE COST :
I.
THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DESIGN OF CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENTS
HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER PRODUCTION COST.
II.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF A NEW EQUIPMENT REDUCES THE PRODUCTION COST BY 5 PERCENT
WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRODUCTION COST FOR AN EXISTING MACHINE, THE
EXISTING MACHINE WILL SUFFER A LOSS IN VALUE EQUAL TO 5 % AND THIS IS
DEFINED AS OBSOLESCENCE COST.

THERE IS NOT ENOUGH UTILIZATION OF THE EQUIPMENT.


4-7C ()
3.
IF THE EQUIPMENT IS PURCHASED THROUGH FINANCE PURCHASING, THE EQUIPMENT
OWNER HAS TO PAY THE REQUIRED LOAN INSTALLMENT TO THE LENDER EVEN WHEN
THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT OPERATIONAL.
4.
ACQUISITION THROUGH BUYING MAY SOMETIMES FORCE THE OWNER TO USE THE
OBSOLETE EQUIPMENT DUE TO FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS.
ADVANTAGES OF RENTING A CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENTS :
1.
LOWER INITIAL INVESTMENT.
2.
ACCESS TO A BROADER RANGE OF EQUIPMENT AT ALL TIMES.
3.

ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE TYPES OF MIXING USED IN CONSTRUCTION SITE :
A.
HAND MIXING : IT IS ADOPTED FOR SMALL WORKS WHERE THE QUANTITY OF
CONCRETE IS SMALL. THE PROCEDURE IS AS FOLLOWS :
1.
A PLATFORM IS CONSTRUCTED BY BRICK OR LEAN CONCRETE OR IRON SHEET AS PER
THE REQUIREMENT OF THE CONCRETE TO BE MIXED.
2.
A MEASURED QUANTITY OF SAND IS UNIFORMLY SPREAD AND REQUISITE AMOUNT
OF CEMENT IS DUMPED OVER IT. SAND AND CEMENT IS MIXED UNIFORMLY.


4-19 ()
3.
ON THE TOP OF THIS THE MEASURED QUANTITY OF STONECHIPS ARE ALSO SPREAD
UNIFORMLY AND MIXED BY SHOVELS FROM CENTRE TO THE SIDE AND THEN BACK TO
CENTRE FOR THREE TIMES.
4.
A HOLLOW IN THE MIDDLE OF MIXED PILE IS CREATED AND A HALF TO THREE
QUARTERS OF REQUIRED QUANTITY OF WATER IS ADDED IN THE HOLLOW WHILE THE
MATERIALS ARE TURNED IN TOWARDS THE CENTRE WITH SHOVEL. THE MIXING TIME
SHOULD NEVER EXCEED THREE MINUTE.
B. MACHINE MIXING :
1.
WHERE A LARGE QUANTITY OF CONCRETE OF THE DESIRED QUALITY IS TO BE PRODUCED,
THE MACHINE MIXING BECOMES IMPERATIVE. CONCRETE CAN BE PRODUCED AT A
FASTER RATE WITH BETTER QUALITY.
2.
MACHINE USED FOR THE PURPOSE IS CALLED CONCRETE MIXER WHICH MAY BE
BATCH TYPE OR CONTINUOUS TYPE.
I.
CONTINUOUS CONCRETE MIXERS :
A.
CONTINUOUS MIXER, THE NAME ITSELF TELLING ITS DUTY THAT THE LOADING, MIXING
AND DISCHARGING OF MIX IS CONTINUOUSLY DONE UNTIL THE WORK IS COMPLETE
OR WORK BREAK OCCURS. THE LOADING OF MATERIALS IS DONE CONTINUOUSLY BY
SCREW FEEDERS.
B.
CONTINUOUS MIXTURES ARE USED FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS SUCH AS DAMS,
BRIDGES, CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH RISE BUILDINGS, ETC.
II.
BATCH CONCRETE MIXERS :
A.
BATCH MIXERS ARE WIDELY USED MACHINES FOR CONCRETE MIXING. CONCRETE
MIX OBTAINED BY THIS MIXER IS COLLECTED BATCH BY BATCH AND TIME BY TIME.
SO, IT IS CALLED AS BATCH MIXER.
B.
AFTER POURING ALL THE MATERIALS INTO PAN OR DRUM, IT MIXES ALL OF THOSE FOR
SOME TIME AND FINALLY DISCHARGES. THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED UNTIL REQUIRED
AMOUNT OF CONCRETE MIX IS OBTAINED.
FOLLOWING ARE TWO TYPES OF BATCH MIXERS :
1.
DRUM TYPE MIXERS : IN CASE DRUM TYPE MIXERS CONCRETE INGREDIENTS
ARE MIXED IN A DRUM WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN DOUBLE CONICAL FRUSTUM SHAPE.
2.

WHEELBARROWS : THESE ARE USUALLY USED TO TRANSPORT CONCRETE IN THE
HORIZONTAL DIRECTION, PROVIDED THERE IS A SMOOTH AND RIGID RUNWAY TO
OPERATE ON.
4.
HAND BUGGIES : THESE ARE SAFER COMPARED TO WHEELBARROWS BECAUSE
THEY HAVE TWO WHEELS WHILE WHEELBARROWS HAVE ONLY ONE WHEEL. THESE
MEANS OF HORIZONTAL TRANSPORTATION ARE PREFERRED WHEN THE DISTANCE TO
BE COVERED IS LESS THAN 60 M.
5.
DROP PIPES AND CHUTES : THESE ARE USED TO TRANSFER CONCRETE FROM
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO LOWER ELEVATIONS.
I.
THE CHUTES USED ARE ROUND-BOTTOMED AND HAVE SUFFICIENT SLOPES TO ALLOW
THE FREE FLOW OF CONCRETE.
II.
DROP PIPES ARE USED IN WALL OR COLUMN CONSTRUCTIONS TO AVOID THE
SEGREGATION OF CONCRETE BY ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF CONCRETE THROUGH

A.
AN INTERNAL VIBRATOR : AS THE NAME INDICATES, IS IMMERSED INTO THE
CONCRETE AND VIBRATED. IT HAS A VIBRATING CASING AND HEAD WHICH IS
IMMERSED INTO THE CONCRETE AND MADE TO VIBRATE AT HIGH FREQUENCY
(10,000 TO 15,000 VIBRATIONS/MIN). THE INTERNAL VIBRATOR IS NORMALLY
PREFERRED IN ALL CONSTRUCTION SITES.
B.
SURFACE VIBRATORS : THEY ARE USED IN SLAB CONSTRUCTION. THESE VIBRATORS
ARE USED FOR CONSOLIDATION ONLY FROM THE TOP SURFACE. THEIR VIBRATION
SPEED IS ABOUT IS ABOUT 3000-6000 VIBRATIONS/MIN.
C.
A FORM VIBRATOR : IT IS AN EXTERNAL VIBRATOR. AS THE NAME INDICATES,
THESE VIBRATORS SHAKE THE ENTIRE FORM (VIBRATE THE ENTIRE FORM). THEY
ARE ATTACHED TO THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE FORM. FORM VIBRATORS ARE USED IN
LARGE PANEL CONSTRUCTION.
QUE 4.15.
WHEN IS IT ECONOMICAL AND DESIRABLE TO USE READY MIX
CONCRETE AT SITE OF CONSTRUCTION ?

PRODUCED, THE RAW MATERIAL AND PRODUCTION PROCESS QUALITY IS BETTER THAN
CONVENTIONAL SITE MIXED CONCRETE.
2.
DURABILITY OF CONCRETE : RMC ENSURES THAT CORRECT WATER-CEMENT
RATIO IS MAINTAINED. HENCE THE DURABILITY OF RMC IS CONSISTENT AND BETTER.
3.
FASTER CONSTRUCTION SPEED :
I.
IN SITE MIXED CONCRETE, THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO MOBILIZE LABOUR FOR MIXING
AS WOLL AS PLACING.
II.
IN RMC, FRESH CONCRETE IS SUPPLIED IN A PLACEABLE CONDITION AND CAN
DIRECTLY BE PLACED BY PUMPING. HENCE, A FASTER CONSTRUCTION SPEED CAN BE
ACHIEVED.

4-22 C ()
EQUIPMENT
4.
ELIMINATION OF STORNGE NEEDS AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE :
I
IN THE CASE OF SITE MIXED CONCRETE. ALL RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS AGGREGITE,
WAND. AND CEMENT HAVE TO BE STORED AT THE SITE.
N
IN THE CASER OF RMC. THIS PROBLEM IS COMPLETELY AVOIDED AS THE STORAGE SI
MATERNALS TAKES PLACE AT THE CENTRAL PLANT.
5
EASIER ADMIXTURE ADDITION : IN RMC. ADMIXTURES CAN BE ADDED IN 1
CONTROLLED MANNER BECAUSE OF THE USE OF SOPHISTICATED COMPUTE.
CONTROLLED METHODS OF RELEASING EXACT QUANTITIES NEEDED. THIS IS
POSSESS 10 NORMAL CONCRETING
6.
DOCUMENTATION OF MIX DESIGNS : THE CONTRACTOR PURCHASES FRESH
CONCRETE FROM THE SUPPLIER OF RMC. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR
DOCUMENTATION BUT ALSO FOR MAINTAINING THE RECORDS.
7.
REDUCTION IN WASTAGE OF MATERIAL : IN RMC, MATERIALS ARE STORED IN
BULK AND USED IN BULK. HENCE, WASTAGE THAT OCCURS IN LOOSE HANDLING OF
CETTENT 15 AVOIDED
& RMC IS ECO-FRIENDLY : THE PRODUCTION OF RMC IS DONE IN AN
ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSESSED AND LICENSED CENTRAL PLANT. HENCE, DUST AND
NOSSE POLLUTION WHICH IS INEVITABLE IN SITE MIXED CONCRETE IS AVOIDED.

OUTLINE : PART- 1
DIRECT COSTS : DIRECT COSTS ARE DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE
RESOURCES INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT E.G., MATERIALS, LABOURS, PLANTS
AND MACHINERY.
INDIRECT COSTS : THE COSTS OF BUYING RESOURCES AND THE COST OF
OPERATIONS INVOLVED EVERY PROJECT INCURS SOME EXPENDITURES IN
TERM OF OVERHEAD ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION, LOST
PROFIT, LOSS OF REVENUE, PENALTY ETC.
TOTAL COST : IT IS A SUM OF DIRECT COST AND INDIRECT COST OF A
PROJECT.
TIME VALUE OF MONEY : THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY (TVM) IS THE
IDEA THAT MONEY AVAILABLE AT THE PRESENT TIME IS WORTH MORE
THAN THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE FUTURE DUE TO ITS POTENTIAL EARNING
CAPACITY.
CASH FLOW DIAGRAM : THE GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE
CASH FLOWS I.E., BOTH CASH OUTFLOWS AND CASH INFLOWS WITH RESPECT

WHAT IS BUDGETING ? WHY IS BUDGETING SO IMPORTANT ?
ANSWER
BUDGETING :
1.
BUDGETING IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING A PLAN TO SPEND YOUR MONEY. THIS
SPENDING PLAN IS CALLED A BUDGET.
2.
CREATING THIS SPENDING PLAN ALLOWS YOU TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER
YOU WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO OR WOULD
LIKE TO DO.


5-3 � C ()
IMPORTANCE OF BUDGETING :
1.
A PROCESS OF TRACKING YOUR EXPENSES.
2.
A SAFETY VALVE TO PREVENT OVER EXPENDITURES.
3.
FINANCIAL CONTROL OF INPUTS.
4.
MANAGEMENT OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES.
5.
PLANNING AND SETTING PRIORITIES.
6. ACCOUNTABILITY.
7.
ENSURES THAT THE FINANCES ARE SPENT FOR TRUE PURPOSE OF SPENDING.
QUE 5.2.
WHAT IS COST PLANNING ? GIVE ITS ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES.
ANSWER
COST PLANNING :
1.
ONCE THE RESOURCE REQUIREMENT IS OBTAINED, THE ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE
EACH OF THESE CAN BE PREPARED BASED ON THE UNIT COST OF THE RESOURCES
AND THE TOTAL UNIT OF THE RESOURCES REQUIRED. THIS PROCESS IS CALLED COST
PLANNING AND IT IS A MUST FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT.
2.
THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A COST PLAN ARE THE PROJECT SCHEDULE AND
ESTIMATES.
ADVANTAGES OF COST PLANNING :
1.
TENDER SUM IS LIKELY TO BE CLOSER TO THE ESTIMATE DERIVED FROM THE COST PLAN.
2.
LESS LIKELIHOOD OF REVISING THE DESIGN.
3.
ENSURE CONT-EFFECTIVENESS AND VALUE FOR MONEY DESIGN IS OBTAINED.
4.
ENSURE A BALANCED DISTRIBUTION OF EXPENDITURE. A MORE RATIONAL DESIGN
WOULD BE OBTAINED.
DISADVANTAGES OF COST PLANNING :
1.
TIME CONSUMING TO PREPARE.
2.
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION. ARCHITECT HAS NOT FIRMED UP ON THE
SPECIFICATIONS.
3.
ARCHITECT HAS TO DRAW MORE DETAILS AND MAKE DESIGN DECISIONS EARLIER TO
PREPARE THE COST PLAN.

EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND ALSO
GIVE ITS IMPORTANCE.
ANSWER
A.
TIME VALUE OF MONEY :
1.
THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY (TVM) IS THE IDEA THAT MONEY AVAILABLE AT THE
PRESENT TIME IS WORTH MORE THAN THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE FUTURE DUE TO
ITS POTENTIAL EARNING CAPACITY.
2
THIS CORE PRINCIPLE OF FINANCE HOLDS THAT, PROVIDED MONEY CAN EARN
INTEREST, ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY IS WORTH THE MORE THE SOONER IT IS RECEIVED
3.
TIME VALUE OF MONEY (TVM) IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT. IT CAN BE USED TO COMPARE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES AND TO
SOLVE PROBLEMS INVOLVING LOANS, LEASES, SAVINGS.
4.
TVM HELP US IN KNOWING THE VALUE OF MONEY INVESTED. AS TIME CHANGES
VALUE OF MONEY INVESTED ON ANY PROJECT/FIRM ALSO CHANGES. AND ITS PRESENT
VALUE IS CALCULATED AS :

05
ANSWER
1.
CASH FLOW FORECASTING IS THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING AN ESTIMATE OR FORECAST
OF A COMPANY FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND IS A CORE PLANNING COMPONENT
OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT WITHIN A COMPANY.
2.
A CASH FLOW FORECAST IS A PROJECTION OF AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE FINANCIAL
POSITION BASED ON ANTICIPATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIVABLES. THE PROCESS OF
DERIVING A CASH FLOW FORECAST IS CALLED CASH FLOW FORECASTING.
GOALS OF CASH FLOW FORECASTING :
1.
THE MAIN GOAL OF A CASH FLOW FORECASTING IS TO ASSIST WITH MANAGING
LIQUIDITY WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION AND ENSURING THAT THE BUSINESS HAS THE
NECESSARY CASH TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND AVOID FUNDING ISSUES, ESSENTIALLY
BETTER MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL.
2.
UNDERNEATH THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, THERE ARE
OFTEN A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY COMPANIES SET UP A CASH FLOW FORECASTING
PROCESS, THESE INCLUDE :

PRESENT ECONOMY STUDIES : THESE ARE ENGINEERING ECONOMY ANALYSIR
WHERE ALTERNATIVES FOR ACCOMPLISHING A SPECIFIC TASK ARE BEING COMPARED
OVER ONE YEAR OR LEAS AND THE INFLUENCE OF TIME ON MONEY CAN BE IGNORED
TWO RUIES SHALL BE FOLLOWED IN CONDUCTING PRESENT ECONOMY STUDIES :
RULE 1 : WHEN REVENUES AND OTHER ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE PRESENT AND
TET AMONG ALTERNATIVES, CHOOSE THE ALTERNATIVE THAT MAXIMIZES OVERALL
PROFITABILITY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DEFECTS FREE UNITS OF A PRODUCT OR
SERVICE PRODUCT.
RULE 2: WHEN REVENUES AND OTHER ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE NOT PRESENT OR
ARE CONSTANT AMONG ALL ALTERNATIVES, CONSIDER ONLY THE COSTS AND SELECT
THE ALTERNATIVE THAT MINIMIZES TOTAL COST PER DEFECT FREE UNIT OF PRODUCT
SERVICE OUTPUT.
PRESENT ECONOMY STUDIES OCCUR IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS :

WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON PROJECT COST ANALYSIS.
05
ANSWER
PROJECT COST ANALYSIS : IT IS ACT OF BREAKING DOWN A COST SUMMARY INTO
ITS CONSTITUENTS AND STUDYING AND REPORTING ON EACH FACTOR.
PROJECT COST ANALYSIS IS DONE BY FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS :
1.
THE NORMAL SOLUTION IS THE ONE CORRESPONDING TO THE NORMAL DURATIONS OF
ALL THE ACTIVITIES GIVING THE MINIMUM DIRECT COST FOR THE PROJECT.
2.
THE CRASH SOLUTION IS THE ONE GIVING THE MINIMUM DIRECT COST
CORRESPONDING TO THE MINIMUM PROJECT DURATION.

5-12 C ()
PROJECT COST
3.
THE ALL-CRASH SOLUTION IS THE ONE CORRESPONDING TO CRASH DURATIONA OF ALL
THE ACTIVITIES.
4
THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS THE ONE GIVING THE MINIMUM TUTAL PROJES COST,
THAT IS, THE SUM OF THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS. AS COMPARED TO THE
NORMAL SOLUTION, THIS SOLUTION LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN THE PROJECT DURATION
WELL AS A SAVING IN THE TOTAL PROJECT COST.

THAT IS, TOTAL PROJECT COST MINUS THE VALUE OF ADDITIONAL BEGEFITS 25 COMPAND
TO THE NORMAL SOLUTION.
QUE 5.12.
DISCUSS ELEMENTS OF COST CONTROL AND ITS IMPORTANCE.
10
ANSWER
A.
ELEMENT OF COST CONTROL : FOLLOWING ARE THE ELEMENT OF COST CONTROL
:
1.
MATERIALS :
I.
MATERIALS COSTS ARE THE TANGIBLE GOODS USED IN PRODUCING THE PRODUCT.
THESE COSTS CAN BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT.
II
DIRECT MATERIALS ARE THE QUANTIFIABLE AND TRACEABLE COSTS OF MATERIALS
USED IN PRODUCTION.
III.
INDIRECT MATERIALS EITHER CANNOT BE TRACED TO PRODUCTS OR IT IS NOT COST
EFFECTIVE TO DO SO.
2
LABOUR :
I
WAGES AND SALARIES PAID TO EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN MANUFACTURING ARE
KNOWN AS LABOUR COSTS.
II.
THESE COSTS CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO DIRECT AND INDIRECT LABOUR.
III.
DIRECT LABOUR COSTS INCLUDE THE WAGES THAT ARE PAID TO EMPLOYEES THAT
PHYSICALLY HANDLE THE PRODUCT.
IV.
FOR THIS REASON, DIRECT LABOR IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS TOUCH LABOUR. INDIRECT
LABOUR COSTS ARE ANY OTHER WAGES AND SALARIES RELATED TO PRODUCTION,
BUT ARE NOT TRACEABLE BACK TO UNITS OF PRODUCT.
3.
OVERHEAD :
I.
OVERHEAD COSTS ARE THOSE COSTS THAT ARE RELATED TO PRODUCTION, BUT ARE
NOT CLASSIFIED AS DIRECT LABOUR OR DIRECT MATERIALS.
II.
THIS INCLUDES ALL INDIRECT LABOUR AND MATERIALS COSTS, AS WELL AS ANY
OTHER UNTRACEABLE COSTS.


5-13 C ()
COMMON OVERHEAD COSTS INCLUDE DEPRECIATION ON FACTORY EQUIPMENT,
MANUFACTURING RENTS, SUPPLIES COSTS, INSURANCE COSTS AND LICENSING FEES.
IV. FOR SOME SMALL BUSINESSES, OVERHEAD COSTS MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF
PRODUCTION COSTS.
V.
IN THESE CASES, SMALL-BUSINESS. OWNERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO RECOGNIZE
THAT JUST BECAUSE OVERHEAD COSTS ARE NOT EASILY TRACEABLE TO PRODUCTS
DOES NOT MEAN THAT EFFECTIVE COST MANAGEMENT IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT.
4.
PERIOD COSTS :
I.
PERIOD COSTS ARE COSTS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO MANUFACTURING.
IL
THESE COSTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN ELEMENT OF COST IN MANAGEMENT
ACCOUNTING.
IL
AS OPPOSED TO PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH ARE HELD IN INVENTORY, GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT PERIOD COSTS ARE EXPENSED
AS SOON AS THEY ARE INCURRED.
IV. COMMON SMALL-BUSINESS PERIOD COSTS INCLUDE ADVERTISING COSTS, SALES
COMMISSIONS. SALARIES FOR OWNERS AND TOP MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS AND DEPRECIATION FOR NON-FACTORY EQUIPMENT.
V. EVEN THOUGH PERIOD COSTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED ELEMENTS OF COST IN
MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING, THESE COSTS REDUCE NET INCOME JUST THE SAME.
VI AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT MAY WISH TO TRACK THESE COSTS ON AN ONGOING
BASIS AND INTERVENE IF THESE COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.
B. INPORTANCE: FOLLOWING ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF COST CONTROL :
1.
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF COST CONTROL OF A PROJECT IS TO GAIN THE MINIMUM
PROFIT WITHIN THE DESIGNATED PERIOD WITHIN THE BUDGET TO MONITOR AND
CONTROL ACTUAL EXPENDITURE AGAINST THE ESTIMATED PROJECT BUDGET.
2
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY UNDER CLAIM OR
OVER CLAIM OF THE WORKDONE.
3.
THIS IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A STEADY CASH FLOW. ALSO IT HELPS THE CLIENT
AND THE CONTRACTOR TO MANAGE THEIR EXPENDITURE AND INCOME.

ANSWER
A.
THE PRESENT WORTH AMOUNT : THE METHOD IS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS :
1.
INDICATE ALL EXPENSES AND BENEFITS AT APPROPRIATE POINT OF TIME IN THE
FORM OF CASH FLOW SEPARATELY FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE. REPRESENT DOWNWARD
ARROWS FOR EXPENSES (COSTS) AND UPWARD ARROWS FOR BENEFITS OR SAVINGS.
IN THE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION + SIGN FOR EXPENSES AND - SIGN FOR BENEFITS.
2
SHIFT THE AMOUNT AT ZERO TIME BY USING PROPER INTEREST FORMULAE AND
FIND TOTAL PRESENT WORTH AMOUNT OF EACH ALTERNATIVE AND COMPARE. THERE
MAY BE TWO CASES.
I.
CASE I: : WHEN SERVICE LIFE OF EACH ALTERNATIVE IS SAME.
ITEM NO. (2) WILL CLEARLY INDICATE WHICH ALTERNATIVE HAS LOWER PRESENT
WORTH. THE ALTERNATIVE HAVING LOWER PRESENT WORTH IS ECONOMICALLY
ACCEPTED.
IL
CASE II: : WHEN SERVICE LIFE OF ALTERNATIVES IS DIFFERENT.
THE CYCLE OF ITEM NO. (2) IS REPEATED TILL THE COMMON SERVICE LIFE IS
OBTAINED. THE COMMON LIFE IS TAKEN AS THE LCM VALUE OF THE GIVEN LIVES.
THE OVERALL PRESENT WORTH OF ALTERNATIVES ARE OBTAINED AND THEN
COMPARED FOR THE SELECTION OF ECONOMICAL ALTERNATIVE.
B. ANNUAL EQUIVALENT AMOUNT :
1.
IN THIS METHOD, CASH FLOW IS CONVERTED INTO A SERIES OF EQUAL ANNUAL
AMOUNT BY FIRST CALCULATING THE PRESENT WORTH AMOUNT FOR THE ORIGINAL
SERIES AND THEN MULTIPLYING IT WITH CAPITAL RECOVERY FACTOR (PINI
2.
THE COMPARISON IS MADE BY SEEING THE ANNUAL EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF
EACH ALTERNATIVE.
C.
THE CAPITALIZED AMOUNT / FUTURE WORTH METHOD :
1.
THE ANNUAL EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OBTAINED IS ASSUMED TO EXTEND FOR IN-
A
FINITE PERIOD AND THE CAPITALIZED AMOUNT IS OBTAINED BY USING
.
2.
THE EQUIVALENT ANNUAL AMOUNT IS CALCULATED FOR REPLACEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE COST AND ADDED TO THE INITIAL COST OF THE ALTERNATIVE.
D.
RATE OF RETURN METHOD :
1.
IT IS DEFINED AS THE INTEREST RATE THAT REDUCES THE PRESENT WORTH AMOUNT
OF A SERIES OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS TO ZERO FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE.
2.
IN ECONOMIC TERMS, THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF RATE OF RETURN IS THAT IT
IS THE RATE OF INTEREST EARNED ON THE UNRECOVERED BALANCE OF AN INVESTMENT
SO THAT THE UNRECOVERED BALANCE IS ZERO AT END OF INVESTMENT'S LIFE.

HENCE, THERE ARISES A NEED TO FORMULATE A REPLACEMENT POLICY WHICH
WOULD ENABLE US IN DECIDING THE AGE AT WHICH THE REPLACEMENT OF THE OLD
EQUIPMENT BY NEW ONE IS MOST ECONOMICAL THAN CONTINUATION OF OLD
EQUIPMENT AT AN INCREASED MAINTENANCE COST.
CAUSES REASONS FOR REPLACEMENT : FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS FOR
REPLACEMENT :
1.
DETERIORATION : DETERIORATION IS THE DECLINE IN PERFORMANCE OF
EQUIPMENT AS COMPARED TO NEW EQUIPMENT IDENTICAL TO THE PRESENT ONE.
IT MAY OCCUR DUE TO EQUIPMENT WEAR, TEAR AND MISALIGNMENT.
IT CAUSES :
I.
INCREASES MAINTENANCE COSTS.
II.

WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD.
ANSWER
DISCOUNT CASH FLOW METHOD :
1.
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) ANALYSIS IS A METHOD OF VALUING A PROJECT,
COMPANY. OR ASSET USING THE CONCEPTS OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY.
2
ALL FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE ESTIMATED AND DISCOUNTED BY USING COST OF
CAPITAL TO GIVE THEIR PRESENT VALUES (PVS).
3.
THE SUM OF ALL FUTURE CASH FLOWS, BOTH INCOMING AND OUTGOING, IS THE NET
PRESENT VALUE (NPV), WHICH IS TAKEN AS THE VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IN
.
4.
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS WIDELY USED IN INVESTMENT FINANCE, REAL
ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, A FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PATENT VALUATION.
DISCOUNTED CASH FORMULA : THIS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FORMULA IS
DERIVED FROM THE FUTURE VALUE FORMULA FOR CALCULATING THE TIME VALUE OF
MONEY AND COMPOUNDING RETURNS.
DCF = + (1 2 + + (1 + R
FV = DCF(1+R)
DISCOUNTED PRESENT VALUE (FOR ONE CASH FLOW IN ONE FUTURE PERIOD) IS
EXPRESSED AS :

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DEPRECIATION ? DESCRIBE THE TYPES
OF DEPRECIATION.
ANSWER
DEPRECIATION : IT IS THE DECREASE IN VALUE OF ASSET RESULTING FROM
DETERIORATION, WEAR AND TEAR FROM YOU, OBSOLESCENCE ARISING FROM
IMPROVEMENT IN DESIGN AND NEW TECHNOLOGY.
TYPES OF DEPRECIATION : FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DEPRECIATION :
1.
PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION :
I.
DEPRECIATION RESULTING IN PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT OF AN ASSET IS KNOWN AS
PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION. THIS RESULTS IN LOWERING THE ABILITY OF THE ASSET TO
RENDER ITS INTENDED SERVICE.
II.
THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF PHYSICAL DEPRECIATION IS WEAR AND TEAR BECAUSE OF
ITS CONSTANT USE SUCH AS ABRASION, SHOCKS, VIBRATION, AND IMPACT ETC. AND
THE DETERIORATION DUE TO ACTION OF ELEMENTS SUCH AS CORROSION OF PIPE,
CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION.
2
FUNCTION DEPRECIATION : FUNCTIONAL DEPRECIATION OFTEN CALLED
OBSOLESCENCE IS DEFINED AS THE LOSS IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DUE TO
CHANGE IN FASHION, DESIGN OR STRUCTURE DUE TO INADEQUATE TO MEET THE
GROWING DEMAND, NECESSITY OF REPLACEMENT DUE TO NEW INVENTION BE
MORE ECONOMICAL AND MORE EFFICIENT ETC.
3.
CONTINGENT DEPRECIATION : IT CAUSES DUE TO :
I.
ACCIDENT (DUE TO NEGLIGENCE),
II.
DISEASES (POLLUTION OF WATER, PARASITES), AND
III. DIMINUTION OF SUPPLY (NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, WATER ETC.)

DEPRECIATION.
OR
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DECLINING BALANCE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION AND
DOUBLE DECLINING BALANCE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION.
201S-14, 10
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE METHODS FOR DETERMINING DEPRECIATION :
A.
STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION METHOD :
1.
STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION IS A VERY COMMON AND SIMPLE METHOD OF
CALCULATING THE EXPENSO. IN STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION, THE EXPENSE AMOUNT
IS THE SAME EVERY YEAR OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET.
2.
DEPRECIATION FORMULA FOR THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD.


5-21 C ()
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE = (COST - SALVAGE VALUE) / USEFUL LIFE
B. DECLINATION BALANCE METHOD :
1.
THE DECLINATION BALANCE METHOD IS WIDELY USED FOR ACCELERATED
DEPRECIATION IN WHICH SOME PERCENTAGE OF STRAIGHT LINE RATES IS USED.
2.
IN THIS METHOD, THE PROPERLY IS ASSUMED TO LOSE VALUE ANNUALLY AT CONSTANT
PERCENTAGE OF ITS BOOK VALUE.
DEPRECIATION,
D=C, X DEPRECIATION FACTOR
1
DEPRECIATION FACTOR (FDB) = 1
-
()
N
C,
WHERE,
C, = INITIAL COST.
C. = SALVAGE VALUE.
N = LIFE OF THE ASSET.
C. DOUBLE DECLINING BALANCE DEPRECIATION METHOD :
1.
PROCESS OF CALCULATION OF DEPRECIATION AND BOOK VALUE FOR EACH YEAR IS THE
SAME AS ADOPTED IN THE DECLINING BALANCE METHOD.
2.
IN THIS METHOD ALSO, THE PROPERTY IS ASSUMED TO LOSE VALUE ANNUALLY BY
FIXED FACTOR OF THE BOOK VALUE.
3.
DEPRECIATION = COST OF EQUIPMENT X FACTOR (FDDB)
FDDB = FIXED FACTOR FOR DOUBLE DECLINING BALANCE METHOD.
4.
FDDB IS TAKEN AS DOUBLE THE STRAIGHT LINE RATE I.E., FDDB =
D. UNITS OF PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION METHOD :
1.
UNITS-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION METHOD DEPRECIATES ASSETS BASED ON
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS USED OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE
PRODUCED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.
2.
THE FORMULA FOR THE UNITS-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE = (NUMBER OF UNITS PRODUCED / LIFE IN NUMBER OF
UNITS) X (COST - SALVAGE VALUE)
E.
SUM-OF-THE-YEARS-DIGITS DEPRECIATION METHOD :
1.
SUM-OF-THE-YEARS-DIGITS METHOD IS ONE OF THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION
METHODS. A HIGHER EXPENSE IS INCURRED IN THE EARLY YEARS WHILE LOWER
EXPENSE IS INCURRED IN THE LATTER YEARS OF THE ASSET.
2.
IN SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS DEPRECIATION METHOD, THE REMAINING LIFE OF AN
ASSET IS DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF THE YEARS AND THEN MULTIPLIED BY THE
DEPRECIATING BASE TO DETERMINE THE EXPENSE.
3.
THE DEPRECIATION FORMULA FOR THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS-DIGITS METHOD:
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE = (REMAINING LIFE / SUM OF THE YEARS DIGITS)
(COST - SALVAGE VALUE).

WHAT IS THE BREAK EVEN COST ANALYSIS ? GIVE ASSUMPTIONS
AND LIMITATIONS OF BREAK EVEN CHART.
ANSWER
A.
BREAK EVEN COST ANALYSIS :
I.
BREAK EVEN COST ANALYSIS IN ECONOMICS, BUSINESS, AND COST ACCOUNTING
REFERS TO THE POINT IN WHICH TOTAL COST AND TOTAL REVENUE ARE EQUAL.
II.
A BREAK EVEN POINT ANALYSIS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF UNITS OR
REVENUE NEEDED TO COVER TOTAL COSTS (FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS).
III.
THE BREAK EVEN ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT TO BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANAGERS
IN DETERMINING HOW MANY UNITS (OR REVENUES) ARE NEEDED TO COVER FIXED
AND VARIABLE EXPENSES OF THE BUSINESS.
B. ASSUMPTIONS OF BREAK EVEN COST ANALYSIS :
FOLLOWING ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS OF BREAK EVEN COST ANALYSIS :
I.
THE TOTAL COSTS MAY BE CLASSIFIED INTO FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS. IT IGNORES
SEMI-VARIABLE COST.
II.
THE COST AND REVENUE FUNCTIONS REMAIN LINEAR.
III.
THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT.
IV.
THE VOLUME OF SALES AND VOLUME OF PRODUCTION ARE EQUAL.
V.
THE FIXED COSTS REMAIN CONSTANT OVER THE VOLUME UNDER CONSIDERATION.
VI. IT ASSUMES CONSTANT RATE OF INCREASE IN VARIABLE COST.
VII. IT ASSUMES CONSTANT TECHNOLOGY AND NO IMPROVEMENT IN LABOUR EFFICIENCY.
VIIII. THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT.

WHAT IS BREAK EVEN CHART ? WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS AND
LIMITATIONS OF BREAK EVEN CHART ?
ANSWER
A.
BREAK EVEN CHART :
I.
A BREAK EVEN CHART IS A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTING OF THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN COSTS AND REVENUE FOR ALL POSSIBLE VOLUMES OF OUTPUT.
II.
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE GRAPHIC DEVICE IS TO DETERMINE THE BREAK EVEN
POINT AND PROFIT POTENTIAL UNDER VARYING CONDITION OF OUTPUT AND COSTS.
III.
IN BRIEF IT MAY BE CALLED A CONTINUOUS INCOME (PROFIT AND LOSS) STATEMENT.
THEREFORE, THE CONCEPT OF BREAK EVEN POINT IS AS FOLLOWS :
1.
PROFIT WHEN REVENUE V TOTAL VARIABLE COST + TOTAL FIXED COST
2.

:
1.
IT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND IT GIVES CRYSTAL CLEAR
VIEW OF THE POSITION OF A BUSINESS.
2.
BEP OF THE CHART CLEARLY NO PROFIT NO LOSS SITUATION.
3
IT IS USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF VARIATIONS OF FIXED COST, VARIABLE
COST AND REVENUE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF A BUSINESS. SO, IT IS USED TO
PORTRAY THE EFFECTS OF PROPOSED CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL POLICY.
4.
ANGLE OF INCIDENCE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY INDICATES THE BUSINESS POSITION
WHETHER FAVOURABLE OR UNFAVOURABLE.
5.
IT INDICATES LIKELY PROFIT OR LOSSES AT VARIOUS OUTPUT LEVELS.
6.
IT IS A DECISION MAKING TOOL IN THE HANDS OF MANAGEMENT.
C.
LIMITATIONS OF BREAK EVEN CHART :
I.
WHEN THE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY NOT REMAIN CONSTANT OVER THE RANGE OF
PROJECTED CAPACITY, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY THE COSTS AS FIXED OR
VARIABLE, THE BEP MAY NOT PORTRAY THE TRUE PICTURE.
II.
THE BREAK EVEN CHART IS A TOOL FOR A SHORT RUN ANALYSIS.
III.
THE TOTAL COST LINE (SUM OF VARIABLE COST AND FIXED COST) NEED NOT BE
STRAIGHT LINE. IN ACTUAL PRACTICE, COSTS DO NOT VARY IN DIRECT PROPORTION.
VI.
THE REVENUE LINE MAY ALSO NOT BE A STRAIGHT LINE.
V.
IT REPRESENTS A STATIC PICTURE WHEREAS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE VERY MUCH
DYNAMIC.
