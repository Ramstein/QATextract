EXPLAIN WITH THE HELP OF NEAT SKETCHES.||THE VARIOUS TYPES OF THE TRUSSES ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS :  2-4 CI) ANALYSIS OF TRUSS A ROOF TRUSSES: REEF PURLINS TAP ENRD GUSCET PLATES BOTTOM CORD KNEE BRACE SPAN BAY FIGURE. 2.2.1. ROOF TRUSS. 1. ROOF TRUSSES ARE OFTEN USED AS PART OF AN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING FRAME, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.2.1. HERE. THE ROOFLOAD IS TRANSMITTED TO THE TRUSS AT THE JOINTS BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF PURLINS. 2 THE ROOFTRUSS ALONG WITH ITS SUPPORTING COLUMNS IS CALLED AS BENT. 3. ORDINARILY, ROOF TRUSSES ARE SUPPORTED EITHER BY COLUMNS OF WOOD, STEEL, OR REINFORCED CONCRETE. OR BY MASONRY WALLS. 4. TO KEEP THE BENT RIGID. AND THEREBY CAPABLE OF RESISTING HORIZONTAL WIND FORCES. KNEE BRACES ARE SOMETIMES USED AT THE SUPPORTING COLUMNS. 5. THE SPACE BETWEEN ADJACENT BENTS IS CALLED A BAY. BAYS ARE ECONOMICALLY SPACED AT ABOUT 4.6 M FOR SPANS AROUND 18 M AND ABOUT 6.1 M FOR SPANS OF 30 M. 6. BAYS ARE OFTEN TIED TOGETHER USING DIAGONAL BRACING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN RIGIDITY OF THE BUILDING'S STRUCTURE. 7. TRUSSES USED TO SUPPORT ROOFS ARE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THE SPAN, THE SLOPE, AND THE ROOF MATERIAL. 8. SOME COMMON TYPES OF TRUSSES ARE SCISSORS TRUSS, THE HOWE AND PRATT TRUSS, FAN TRUSS OR FINK TRUSS, WARREN TRUSS, SAWTOOTH TRUSS, BOWSTING TRUSS ETC. B. BRIDGE TRUSSES : 1. THE MAIN STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF A TYPICAL BRIDGE TRUSS ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.2.2 HERE IT IS SEEN THAT A LOAD ON THE DECK IS FIRST TRANSMITTED TO STRINGERS, THEN TO FLOOR BEAMS, AND FINALLY TO THE JOINTS OF THE TWO SUPPORTING SIDE TRUSSES. 2 THE TOP AND BOTTOM CORDS OF THESE SIDE TRUSSES ARE CONNECTED BY TOP AND BOTTOM LATERAL BRACING, WHICH SERVES TO RESIST THE LATERAL FORCES CAUSED BY WIND AND THE SIDEWAY CAUSED BY MOVING VEHICLES ON THE BRIDGE. 3. ADDITIONAL STABILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE PORTAL AND SWAY BRACING. 4. AS IN THE CASE OF MANY LONG-SPAN TRUSSES, A ROLLER IS PROVIDED AT ONE END OF A BRIDGE TRUSS TO ALLOW FOR THERMAL EXPANSION. 5. A FEW OF THE TYPICAL FORMS OF BRIDGE TRUSS: PRATT, HOWE AND WARREN TRUNSES ARE NORMALLY USED FOR SPANS UP TO 61 IN IN LENGTH. 6. FOR LARGER SPANS, A TRUSS WITH A POLYGONAL UPPER CORD, SUCH AS THE PARKER TRUSS, IS USED FOR SOME SAVINGS IN MATERIAL.   25C () 7.

JOINT ANALYSIS SHOULD START AT A JOINT HAVING ATLEAST ONE KNOWN FORCE AND ATMOST TWO UNKNOWN FORCES. III. IF A FORCE IS PUSHING ON THE PIN, MEMBER WILL BE IN COMPRESSION AND VICE- VERSA. IV. DURING SOLUTION OF A TRUSS ALWAYS ASSUME THE UNKNOWN MEMBER FORCE ACTING ON THE JOINT'S FREE BODY DIAGRAM TO BE IN TENSION. V.

FIRST CALCULATE THE EXTERNAL SUPPORT REACTIONS BY DRAWING THE FREE BODY DIAGRAM OF THE ENTIRE TRUSS. II. DRAW FREE BODY DIAGRAM OF A JOINT HAVING AT LEAST ONE KNOWN FORCE AND ATMOST TWO UNKNOWN FORCES. III. ASSUME THE UNKNOWN MEMBER FORCE AS TENSILE IN NATURE I.E., FORCE IS PULLING THE JOINT. IV. NOW ORIENTATION OF X AND Y AXES ARE TO MADE SUCH THAT FORCES ON THE FREE BODY DIAGRAM CAN BE EASILY RESOLVED INTO THEIR X AND Y COMPONENTS. V. APPLY TWO FORCE EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS CF, = O AND >F, = O. SOLVE THESE TWO EQUATIONS TO GET UNKNOWN MEMBER FORCE AND THEN VERIFY THEIR CORRECT DIRECTIONAL SENSE. VI. CONTINUE TO ANALYZE EACH OF THE OTHER JOINTS, WHERE AGAIN IT IS NECESSARY TO CHOOSE A JOINT HAVING ATLEAST ONE KNOWN FORCE AND ATMOST TWO UNKNOWN FORCES. 2. METHOD OF SECTIONS : I. IF THE FORCES IN ONLY A FEW MEMBERS OF A TRUSS ARE TO BE FOUND, THEN THE METHOD OF SECTIONS GENERALLY USED TO OBTAIN THESE FORCES. II. THE METHOD OF SECTION INVOLVES PASSING AN IMAGINARY SECTION THROUGH THE TRUSS, THUS CUTTING IT INTO TWO PARTS. III. EACH OF THE TWO PARTS MUST ALSO BE IN EQUILIBRIUM. IV. TRY TO SELECT THE ISOLATED PORTION OF THE TRUSS HAVE NOT MORE THAN THREE UNKNOWN FORCE MEMBERS. V. SINCE ONLY THREE INDEPENDENT EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS ARE PRESENT AS : EF, = O, CF, = O AND >M = O. PROCEDURE TO ANALYZE : I. FIRSTLY CUT OR CHOOSE A SECTION OF TRUSS WHERE FORCES ARE TO BE DETERMINED. II. SELECTING THE SECTION, IT MAY FIRST BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE TRUSS'S EXTERNAL REACTIONS. III. DRAW THE FREE BODY DIAGRAMS OF THE SELECTED OR SECTIONED TRUSS HAVING THE LEAST NUMBER OF FORCES ON IT. IV. LET THE MEMBER FORCE AS TENSILE IN NATURE, I.E., PULLING ON THE MEMBER JOINT PIN. V. TAKE SUMMATION OF THE MOMENT ABOUT A POINT THAT LIES AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE LINES OF ACTION OF TWO UNKNOWN FORCES. VI. IF TWO OF THE UNKNOWN FORCES ARE PARALLEL, FORCES MAY BE SUMMED PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION OF THESE UNKNOWNS TO DETERMINE DIRECTLY THE THIRD UNKNOWN FORCE.

THE TECHNIQUE CONSISTS OF REMOVING ONE OF THE EXISTING MEMBERS AT A NODE SO THAT ONLY TWO MEMBERS WITH UNKNOWN FORCES REMAIN AND SUBSTITUTING ANOTHER MEMBER SO AS TO MAINTAIN THE TRUSS IN STABLE EQUILIBRIUM. 4.

THE PROFILE SO FORMED IS IN EQUILIBRIUM UNDER THE ACTION OF THE APPLIED LOADS (P1. P2 AND P3). 4. IN CASES THE STRUCTURE HAS THE PROFILE OF THE FORCE POLYGON, THE BENDING MOMENT AT ANY SECTION WILL BE ZERO. 5. THE STRUCTURE IN SUCH A CASE WILL BE SUBJECTED ONLY TO AXIAL COMPRESSION. 6. SUCH A PROFILE ALONG THE LENGTH OF A BEAM OR FRAME IS KNOWN AS PRESSURE LINE OR LINE OF THRUST. 7. THE PRESSURE LINE THUS REPRESENTS THE PROFILE FOR A GIVEN SYSTEM OF FORCES, WHICH WOULD INDUCE ONLY COMPRESSIVE FORCES. 8. THE PROFILE OF A PRESSURE LINE RESEMBLES AN ARCH WITH LINEAR SEGMENTS, THE PROFILE IS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS A LINEAR ARCH. 9. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN SUCH A PROFILE FOR ALL COMBINATIONS OF LOADS ON A STRUCTURE. 10. THE PRESSURE LINE VARIES FROM ONE LOADING CASE TO ANOTHER. 11.

J = 6 I. EXTERNAL INDETERMINACY, I=R-E=4-3=1 II. INTERNAL INDETERMINACY, I = M - (2J - 3) =11-(2X6-3)=2 - - III. TOTAL INDETERMINACY, I=1, + II = 1 + 2 = 3 MIMIN 4 FIGURE. 1.13.1.
88|DISCUSS THE CABLES||. CABLES ARE USED AS SUPPORT AS WELL AS FOR TRANSMISSION OF LOADS FROM ONE MEMBER TO THE OTHER. CABLE STANDS FOR A FLEXIBLE TENSION MEMBER.
88|WHAT IS THE EXPRESSION FOR COMPUTING THE LENGTH OF A CABLE FOR HORIZONTAL SPAN 'L' AND CENTRAL DIP 'H' WHEN BOTH SUPPORT ARE AT SAME LEVEL||. LENGTH OF CABLE, 1 = L + 3 L
88|WRITE DOWN THE EXPRESSION FOR LENGTH OF CABLE, WHEN SUPPORTS ARE AT DIFFERENT LEVEL. ||: LENGTH OF CABLE IN THIS CASE IS GIVEN BY, 1=11+12 AND,
88|GIVE THE EXPRESSION FOR HORIZONTAL REACTION AND TENSION AT ENDS OF SUSPENSION CABLE.|| I. HORIZONTAL REACTION, WT2 H = 8H II. TENSION IN CABLE T
88|DIFFERENTIATE STATIC AND KINEMATIC INDETERMINACY OF STRUCTURE.||. S.NO. STATIC INDETERMINACY KINEMATIC INDETERMINACY 1. STATIC INDETERMINACY OF A IT IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF ALL THE STRUCTURE IS DEFINED AS THE POSSIBLE DISPLACEMENTS THAT VARIOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NUMBER JOINTS OF THE STRUCTURE CAN OF UNKNOWN FORCES AND UNDERGO. NUMBER OF EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS TO BE SOLVED. 2. DEGREE OF STATIC DEGREE OF KINEMATIC INDETERMINACY = (M+R)-2J. INDETERMINACY = SUM OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM IN ROTATION AND TRANSLATION.
88|WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY STABILITY OF PLANE TRUSS ?||. M = NUMBER OF MEMBERS (OR BARS), J = TOTAL NUMBER OF JOINTS, AND R = NUMBER OF REACTION COMPONENTS. I. 2I STRUCTURE IS STATICALLY DETERMINATE. II. 2J<M+R= STRUCTURE IS STATICALLY INDETERMINATE. III. 2J>M+R: STRUCTURE IS A MECHANISM AND ALWAYS UNSTABLE.
88|DEFINE TRUSS.|| TRUSS IS A GEOMETRIC ARRANGEMENT OF ITS MEMBERS, THE MEMBERS ARE SUBJECTED TO TENSILE OR COMPRESSIVE FORCE ONLY. THUS, TO SUPPORT A GIVEN LOAD A TRUSS UTILIZES LESSER MATERIALS AS COMPARED TO A BEAM. 22 WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF PLANE TRUSSES ? I ON THE BASIS OF UTILITY OF TRUSSES : A. ROOF TRUSS, AND B. BRIDGE TRUSS. IL ON THE BASIS OF THE GEOMETRICAL CONFIGURATION : A SIMPLE TRUSS, B. COMPOUND TRUSS, AND C. COMPLEX TRUSS. 23. DEFINE SPACE TRUSS WITH SUITABLE SKETCH. ANR SPACE TRUSSES HAVE MEMBERS EXTENDING IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND SPACE ARE TRUSS CONSISTS OF MEMBERS JOINED TOGETHER AT THEIR ENDS TO SUITABLE FOR DERRICKS AND TOWERS. I. II IT IS FORMED BY CONNECTING SIX MEMBERS TOGETHER WITH FOUR JOINTS. THE SIMPLEST ELEMENT OF A STABLE TRUSS IS A TETRAHEDRON. FORM A STABLE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE. II P FIGURE.
88|DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PLANE AND SPACE TRUSS.||. PLANE TRUSSES ARE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS THAT LIE IN THE SAME PLANE"
88|DERIVE THE RELEVANT EXPRESSION FOR THE BENDING OF CURVED BARS WITH SMALL INITIAL CURVATURE.||A RECTANGULAR SIMPLY SUPPORTED BEAM HAVING SECTION AS 150 MM X 200 MM HAS A SPAN OF 8 M. THE BEAM IS SUBJECTED TO TWO POINT LOAD OF 25 KN EACH AT 2 M AND 6 M FROM LEFT SUPPORT. THE PLANE OF LOADS MAKES AN ANGLE OF 30° WITH THE VERTICAL PLANE OF SYMMETRY.
