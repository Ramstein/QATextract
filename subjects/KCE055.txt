Fig. 1.1.1. The hydrologic cycle.
Hydrologic cycle is the process of transfer of moisture from the
atmosphere to the earth in the form of precipitation, conveyance of
the precipitated water by streams and rivers to ocean and lakes etc.,
and evaporation of water back to the atmosphere as shown in
Fig. 1.1.1.
This cycle consists of the following processes :
1.
Evaporation and Transpiration (E) : The water from the surfaces
of ocean, rivers, lakes and also from the moist soil evaporates. The

1-3 C (CE-Sem-4)
vapours are carried over the land by air in the form of clouds.
Transpiration is the process of water being lost from the leaves of
the plants from their pores. Thus the total evaporation (E). inclusive
of the transpiration consists of:
i.
Surface evaporation.
Water surface evaperation.
a
From river surface.
b.
From oceans.
iii.
Evaporation from plants and leaves (transpiration).
iv. Atmospheric evaporation.
2
Precipitation (P): Precipitation may be defined as the fall of moisture
from the atmosphere to the earth surface in any form. Precipitation
may be of two forms :
i
Liquid precipitation : i.e. rainfall.
ii
Frozen precipitation : This consists of :
a Snow.
b. Hail.
c. Sleet.
d Freezing rain.
3. Runoff (R) : Runoff is that portion of precipitation that is not
evaporated When moisture falls to the earth's surface as precipitation,
a part of it is evaporated from the water surface, soil and vegetation
and through transpiration by plants. and the remainder precipitation
is available as runoff which ultimately runs to the ocean through surface
or sub-surface streams. Thus runoff may be classified as follows :
i.
Surface Runoff : Water flows over the land and is first to reach the
streams and rivers, which ultimately discharge the water to the sea.
ii. Inter-flow or Sub-Surface Runoff : A portion of precipitation
infiltrates into surface soil and depending upon the geology of the
basins, runs as sub-surface runoff and reaches the streams and rivers.
iii. Groundwater Flow or Base Flow : It is that portion of precipitation,
which after infiltration, percolates down and joins the groundwater
reservoir which is ultimately connected to the ocean.
Thus, the hydrologic cycle may be expressed by the following simplified
equation :
Precipitation (P) = Evaporation (E) + Runoff (R)

Answer
Hydrology :
Scanned with CamScanner
1-4 C ((CE-Sem-8)
Introduction to Hydrology
1.
It is the science that deals with the occurrence, circulation and
distribution and movement of water on the earth, including that in the
atmosphere and below the surface of the earth.
2.
As a branch of earth science, it is concerned with the water in streams
and lakes, rainfall and snowfall. snow and ice on the land and water
occurring below the earth's surface in the pores of the soil and rocks.
Knowledge of Hydrology :
The basic knowledge of this science is a must for every civil engineer,
particularly the one who is engaged in the design. planning or
construction of irrigation structures, bridges, and highway culverts, or
flood control works, etc.
1.
Maximum flows, after different years, are expected at a spillway or a
highway culvert in a city drainage system.
2.
Minimum reservoir capacity will be sufficient to assure adequate water
for irrigation or municipal water supply, during droughts.
Que 1.3.
What is the purpose of water budget equation in
hydrology ? Also give the expression for the water budget of
catchment for a time interval At and write in brief about all the
associated terms in this equation.
Answer
Purpose of Water Budget Equation :
1.
Large cities and urban sprawl particularly affect local climate and
hydrology.
2.
Urbanization is accompanied by accelerated drainage of water through
road drains and city sewer systems, which even increases the magnitude
of urban flood events.
3.
This alters the rates of infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration that
would otherwise occur in a natural setting.
4.
The replenishing of ground water aquifers does not occur or occurs at a
slower rate.
5.
Together, these various effects determine the amount of water in the
system and can result in extremely negative consequences for river
watersheds, lake levels, aquifers, and the environment as a whole.
6.
Therefore, it is vital to learn about the water budget equation which
consists of inflows, outflows, and storage.
Expression :
1.
Expression for the water budget of a catchment for a time interval At
is written as.
P - R - G - E - T = AS
(1.3.1)
where,
P = Precipitation.

S.
All terms in eq. (1.8.1) have the dimensions of volume. Note that all
these terms can be expressed as depth over the catchment area (e.g.,
in centimeters), and in fact this is a very common unit.
4.
In terms of rainfall-runoff relationship, equation (1.3.1) can be
represented as
R = P - L
(1.3.2)
where, L = Losses = Water not available to runoff due to infiltration
(causing addition to soil moisture and groundwater storage),
evaporation, transpiration and surface storage.
Que 1.4.
Write short note on global water budget.
Answer
Global Water Budget :
1.
Water is the most important natural resource which is vital for all
forms of life on the earth.
2.
Water is a crucial element in development planning.
3.
The total quantity of water in the world is roughly 1360 million cubie
kilometers out of which about 97.2 % is held up in seas and oceans
while about 2.1 % is frozen in ice caps, and about 0.31 % is available as
deep ground water. Thus 99.6 % of total water is of no use to man.
Que 1.5.
A lake had water surface elevation of 103.200 m above
datum at the beginning of certain month. In that month, the lake
reserved an average inflow of 6.0 cumecs from surface runoff
sources. If the same period outflow from the lake have an average
value of 6.5 cumecs. Further in that month, the lake received a
rainfall of 145 mm and evaporation from lake surface was estimated
at 6.10 cm. Write the water budget equation for lake and calculate
the water surface elevation of the lake at end of month. The average
lake surface area may be taken as 5000 hectares. Assume that there
is no contribution to or from groundwater storage.

Que 1.6.
What do you understand by precipitation ? Explain
various types of precipitation.
Scanned with CamScanner
Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
1-7C (CE-Sem-4)
Answer
Precipitation : To the hydrologist, precipitation is the general term
for all forms of moisture emanating from the clouds and falling to
the ground.
Types of Precipitation :
1.
Cyclonic Precipitation : Cyclonic precipitation results from lifting
of air masses converging into low pressure area of cyclone. The
cyclonic precipitation may be divided into (a) Frontal precipitation,
and (b) Non-frontal precipitation.
2
Convective Precipitation :
i.
Convective precipitation is caused by natural rising of warmer lighter
air in colder, denser surroundings.
il
The difference in temperature may result from unequal heating at
the surface, unequal cooling at the top of the air layer, or mechanical
lifting when air is forced to pass over denser colder air masses.
ill. Convective precipitation is spotty and its intensity may vary from
light showers to cloud bursts.
3.
Orographic Precipitation :
i.
Orographic precipitation is due to the lifting of warm moisture laden
air masses due to topographic barriers (such as mountains).
ii.
As it reaches higher elevation, it comes in contact with cold air and
precipitation occurs.
iii.
The zone to the other side of the mountain will be the zone of rain
shadow area where the rainfall may not occur, as shown in Fig. 1.6.1.
iv.
All the precipitation we have in Himalayan region is because of the
orographic ascent of air masses, rich in moisture content because of
their long travel over oceans.

Precipitation Due to Turbulent Ascent :
i.
Air mass is forced to rise up due to greater friction of earth surface
after its travel over ocean.
ii.
The air mass rises up because of increased turbulence and friction,
when it ultimately condenses and precipitation occurs.

B : Non-automatic rain-gauge.
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 10
OR
Discuss the current practice and status of the rainfall recording
in India.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 05
Answer
Rain-gauge : The amount of precipitation is expressed as the depth
in centimetres (or inches) which falls on a level surface, and is measured
by rain-gauge.
Types of Rain-gauge : Following are the types of rain-gauges used
for measurement of rainfall :
A.
Non-automatic Rain-gauge : This is also known as non-recording
rain-gauge. Symon's rain-gauge is the instrument prescribed by use
at all Government rain-gauge stations throughout India.
Symon's Rain-gauge :
i.
Symon's rain-gauge is most common type of non-automatic rain-
gauge, and is used by Meteorological Department of Government of
India.
ii.
As shown in Fig. 1.7.1, it consists of cylindrical vessel 127 mm in
diameter with a base enlarged to 210 mm diameter.
iii. The top section is a funnel provided with circular brass rim exactly
127 mm internal diameter.
iv.
The funnel shank is inserted in the neck of a receiving bottle which
is 75 to 100 mm diameter.
v.
A receiving bottle of rain-gauge has a capacity of about 75 to 100 mm
of rainfall and as during a heavy rainfall this quantity is frequently
exceeded, the rain should be measured 3 or 4 times in a day on day of
heavy rainfall left the receiver fill should overflow.
vi. A cylindrical graduated measuring glass is furnished with each
instrument, which reads to 0.2 mm.
vii. The rainfall should be estimated to the nearest of 0.1 mm.

ii.
The weighing bucket rain-gauge essentially consists of a receiver
bucket supported by a spring or lever balance or any other weighing
mechanism.
iii.
The movement of the bucket due to its increasing weight is transmitted
to a pen which traces the record on a clock-drive chart.
2
Tipping Bucket Type Rain-gauge :
i.
A Steven's tipping bucket type rain-gauge consists of 300 mm diameter
sharp edge receiver.
ii.
At the end of the receiver a funnel is provided. A pair of buckets are
pivoted under the funnel in such a way that when one bucket receives
0.25 mm of precipitation, it tips, discharging its contents into a container
bringing the other bucket under the funnel.
iii. Tipping of the bucket completes an electric circuit causing the
movement of pen to mark on clock driven revolving drum which
carries a record sheet.
iv. The electric pulses generated due to the tipping of the buckets are
recorded at the control room far away from the rain gauge station.

Explain the different methods of determining the
average rainfall over a eatchment due to storm.
Answer
Methods of Average Rainfall Over - Catchment :
Following are the methods of determining the average rainfall over
a catchment :
Scanned with CamScanner
Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
1-15 C (CE-Sem-4)
1.
Arithmetic Average Method :
i.
If the rainfall is uniformly distributed on its areal pattern, the simplest
method of estimating average rainfall is to compute arithmetic average
of the recorded rainfall values at various stations.
ii.
Thus, if P, P2,Ps
Pr etc., are the precipitation or rainfall values
n
measured at n gauge stations, we have
P av = + n 1
2
Thiessen Polygon Method :
o
i.
The arithmetic average method is most approximate method since
rainfall varies in intensity and duration from place to place.
ii.
Hence, rainfall recorded by each rain-gauge station should be weighed
according to the area it is assumed to represent.
iii.
This method is a more common method of weighing the rain-gauge
observations according to the area.
iv. This method is also called weighted mean method and is more accurate
than the arithmetic average method.
B
D:
Fig. 1.13.1. Thiessen polygon method.
Procedure
i.
Join the adjacent rain-gauge stations, A, B, C, D, etc., by straight
lines.
ii.
Construct the perpendicular bisectors of each of these lines.
iii. A Thiessen network is thus constructed. The polygon formed by the
perpendicular bisectors around a station encloses an area which is
everywhere closer to that station than to any other station. Find the
area of each of these polygons shown hatched in Fig. 1.13.1.
iv.
Multiply the area of each Thiessen polygon by the rain-gauge value
of enclosed station.
v.
Find the total area (DA) of the basin.

Isohyetal Method :
i.
The basic assumption in the Thiessen polygon method is that a rain-
gauge station best represents the area which is close to it.
ii.
However, this may not always be valid, especially when the rainfall
is controlled by topography or results from intense convection.
iii.
The Isohyetal method is the most elaborate and accurate in such
conditions.
iv. An Isohyet is a line, on a rainfall map of the basin, joining places of
equal rainfall readings.
v,
An isohyetal map showing contours of equal rainfall presents a more
accurate picture of the rainfall distribution over the basin.

On this map, drawn to a suitable scale, a uniform rectangular grid at
some suitable spacing is superimposed.

At the corners of the grid points, precipitation is estimated suitably
by considering the weather and storm characteristics of the basin.

The average precipitation of the four grid corners is then multiplied
by the area of the grid, to give the average precipitation volume of
the grid.

The sum of all such products divided by the total area of the basin

Answer
1.
Intensity Duration Analysis :
i.
It has generally been observed that greater the intensity of rainfall,
shorter is the length of time it continues.
ii.
As the duration of storm increases, the maximum intensity of storm
decreases.

iv.
The curve represented by equation (1.17.1) will be hyperbolic.

Paulhus suggests that if rainfall is plotted against duration in a log-
log scale, the World's greatest recorded rainfalls lie on or just under
a straight line whose equation is
R = 16.6 0.475
where, R = Rainfall (inches), D = Duration (hours).
2.
Intensity Duration Frequency Relationship :
i.
It is observed that a storm of any given duration will have larger
intensity if its return period is large.
ii.
This means that for storm of given duration, storms of higher intensity
in that duration is rarer than storms of smaller intensity.

Depth Area Relationship :
i
The areal distribution characteristics of a storm of given duration is
reflected in the depth area relationships and depth area curves.
il
Precipitation rarely occurs uniformly over the whole area.
iii. For a rainfall of a given duration, the average depth of rainfall decreases
from the maximum (or highest) value as the considered area increases.
iv. The relationship is expressed by the following equation :
P = P. kA n

Rainfall rarely occurs uniformly over the whole of the catchment.
ii.
Variations in total depth of rainfall and intensity occur from the
centres to the peripheries of storms.
iii. The knowledge of maximum depth of rainfall occurring on areas of

What is meant by probable maximum precipitation
(PMP) over a basin ? Explain how PMP is estimated.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 05
AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
A.
Probable Maximum Precipitation :
1.
The probable maximum precipitation, commonly known as PMP, for
a region is the precipitation resulting from the most critical
meteorological combinations that are considered probable of occurence.
2.
It can be defined as that rainfall over a basin which would produce
the flood flow with virtually no risk of being exceeded.
3.
From the statistical studies, PMP can also be estimated from the
following equation :
PMP = P + Ko
where,
P = Mean of annual maximum rainfall series.
0 = Standard deviation of the series.
K = Frequency factor, which is usually in the
neighbourhood of 15.
B. Maximum and Minimum Rainfall : The magnitudes of maximum
rainfall and minimum rainfall within specified time period can be
determined by the use of frequency formula given by Hazen :
2N
N
T =
2m - 1 m - 0.5
where, T = Recurrence interval within which the event is either
equal to or greater than the specified amount.

Procedure for Determination of Maximum Rainfall :
1.

(m) to each rainfall event, the total number of event being equal to N.
2.
Compute recurrence interval (T) for each event.
3.

corresponding rainfall as ordinate.
4.
Determine the expected maximum rainfall magnitude for any desired
value of T from this graph.
Procedure for Determination of Minimum Rainfall :

Discuss briefly the various abstractions that take place
precipitation.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 05
Answer
Abstractions from Precipitation : When precipitation takes place
on land surface whole of it is not available as runoff because of losses
that take place during or after the precipitation. Important losses consist
of,
i.
Interception.
ii. Evaporation.
iii. Transpiration.
iv. Infiltration.
v.
Depression storage. vi. Watershed leakage.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-26 C (CE-Sem-8)
Introduction to Hydrology
Out of this evaporation transpiration and infiltration are the major
losses.
1.
Interception :
i.
It
may be defined as that amount of precipitation water which is
intercepted by vegetative foliage, buildings and other objects lying over
the land surface.
ii.
Interception does not reach the land surface but is returned back to the
atmosphere by evaporation.
iii.
The intercepted precipitation may follow one of the three possible
routes :
a.
It may be retained by the vegetation as surface storage and
returned to the atmosphere by evaporation; this is known as
interception loss.
b.
It can drip off the plant leaves to join the ground surface or the
surface flow; this is known as throughfall.
c.
The rainwater may run along the leaves and branches and down
the stem to reach the ground surface. This part is called stemflow.
2.
Depression Storage :
i.
A catchment area generally has many depressions of shallow depth and
of varying size and shape.
ii.
When precipitation take place, water runs towards these depressions
and fill them before actual overland flow or runoff towards a stream
takes place.
iii.
Depression storage depends on a vast number of factors. The major
factors are :
a.
The type of soil.
b.
The condition of the surface reflecting the amount and nature
of depression.
c.
The slope of the catchment.
d.
The antecedent precipitation as a measure of the soil moisture.
iv.
The following relationship may be used for computing the depression
storage,
=
where,
Vda = Volume of water stored in surface depression.
P. = Rainfall excess.
k = Depression storage capacity of the basin.
3.
Watershed Leakage :
i.
Adjacent basins are separated by ridge lines, so that rainfall falling over
a basin flows towards the drainage lines (i.e., streams) of the basin.

Watershed leakage may be defined as flow of water from one basin to
another basin, or from one basin to the sea through major faults, fissures
or other geographical features.

Due to these faults, fissures, underground hydraulic conduits so formed
convey the discharge falling over a part of the catchment.

Define evaporation. Discuss the factors that affect the
evaporation from a water body.
AKTU 2016-17, Marks 10
Answer
A Evaporation : It is the process in which a liquid changes to the
gaseous state at the free surface, below the boiling point through the
transfer of heat energy.
B.
Factors : Following are the factors that affect the evaporation from
the water body :
1.
Vapour Pressure : The rate of evaporation is proportional to the
difference between the saturation vapour pressure at the water
temperature, ew and the actual pressure in the air, ea. Thus,
EL =Clew-e =
(1.20.1)
where,
EL = Rate of evaporation (mm/day).
C = Constant.
ew and e are in mm of mercury.
2 Temperature : Other factors remaining the same, the rate of
evaporation increases with an increase in the water temperature.
3.
Wind : Wind aids in removing the evaporated water vapour from the
zone of evaporation and consequently creates greater scope for
evaporation.
4.
Atmospheric Pressure : Other factors remaining same, a decrease
in the barometric pressure, as in high altitudes, increases evaporation
Scanned with CamScanner
1-28 C (CE-Sem-8)
Introduction to Hydrology
5.
Soluble Salts :
i.
When a solute is dissolved in water, the vapour pressure of the
solution is less than that of pure water and hence causes reduction
in the rate of evaporation.
ii.
The percent reduction in evaporation approximately corresponds to
the percentage increase in the specific gravity.
6.
Heat Storage in Water Bodies :
i.
Deep water bodies have more heat storage than shallow ones.
ii.
A deep lake may store radiation energy received in summer and
release it in winter causing less evaporation in summer and more
evaporation in winter compared to a shallow lake exposed to a similar
situation.
iii.
However, the effect of heat storage is essentially to change the seasonal
evaporation rates and the annual evaporation rate is seldom affected.

ISI Standard Pan :
i.
This pan evaporimeter specified by IS: 5973-1970, also known as
modified class A pan, consists of a pan 1220 mm in diameter with
255 mm of depth.
ii
The pan is made of copper sheet of 0.9 mm thickness, tinned inside
and painted white outside as shown in Fig. 2.21.2.
iii.
A fixed point gauge indicates the level of water. A calibrated cylindrical
measure is used to add or remove water maintaining the water level
in the pan to a fixed mark.
iv. The top of the pan is covered fully with a hexagonal wire netting of
galvanized iron to protect the water in the pan from birds.
v.
Further, the presence of a wire mesh makes the water temperature
more uniform during day and night.
vi. The evaporation from this pan is found to be less by about 14 %
compared to that from unscreened pan.

Discuss some important empirical evaporation
equations in detail.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-30 C (CE-Sem-8)
Introduction to Hydrology
Answer
Empirical Evaporation Equations : Following are the empirical
evaporation equations :
1.
Dalton Equation : It can be expressed as
EL = Kf(u)(e w ea)
(1.22.1)
where, EL = Lake evaporation in mm/day.
ew = Saturated vapour pressure at the water surface
temperature in mm of mercury.
e = Actual vapour pressure of overlying air at a specified
height in mm of mercury.
f(u) = Wind speed correction function.
K = A co-efficient.
2.
Meyer's Formula : It can be given by,
= E e a 1 us 16
(1.22.2)
where, us = Monthly mean wind velocity in km/h at about 9 m
above ground.
Km = Co-efficient accounting for various other factors with
a value of 0.36 for large deep waters and 0.50 for small,
shallow waters.
3.
Rohwer's Formula : Rohwer's formula considers a correction for
the effect of pressure in addition to the wind speed effect and is
given by,
EL = 0.771(1.465 - 0.000732 )(0.44 0.0733 a (1.22.3)
where, Pa = Mean barometric reading in mm of mercury.
= Mean wind velocity in km/h at ground level, which can
be taken to be the velocity at 0.6 m height above ground.

Explain the different analytical methods for the
determination of lake evaporation.
Answer
Analytical Methods : Following are the three analytical methods
for determination of lake evaporation :
1.
Water-Budget Method :
i.
It is the simplest method and is also the least reliable.
ii.
It involves writing the hydrological continuity equation for the lake
and determining the evaporation from a knowledge or estimation of
other variable.
iii.

Answer
1 Evapotranspiration :
i
Transpiration is the process by which water leaves the body of a
livitiz plant and reaches the atmosphere as water vapour.
E
While transpiration takes place, the land area in which plants stand
also lose moisture by the evaporation of water from soil and water
bodies.
in
In hydrology and irrigation practice, it is found that evaporation and
transpiration processes can be considered advantageously under one
head as evapotranspiration.
2
Consumptive Use: The term consumptive use is also used to denote
the loss by evapotranspiration. For a given set of atmospheric conditions,
revapotranspiration obviously depends on the availability of water.
3
Potential Evapotranspiration :
i
If sufficient moisture is always available completely to meet the needs
of vegetation fully covering the area, the resulting evapotranspiration
is called potential evapotranspiration (PET).
ii.
Potential evapotranspiration no longer critically depends on the soil
and plant factors but depends essentially on the climatic factors.
4. Actual Evapotranspiration : The real evapotranspiration occurring
in a specific situation is called actual evapotranspiration (AET).
5. Field Capacity : It is defined as the maximum quantity of water
that the soil can retain against the force of gravity. Any higher moisture
input to a soil at field capacity simply drains away.
6.
Permanent Wilting Point :
i.
It is the moisture content of a soil at which the moisture is no longer
available in sufficient quantity to sustain the plants.
ii.
At this stage, even though the soil contains some moisture, it will be
so held by the soil grains that the roots of the plants are not able to
extract it in sufficient quantities to sustain the plants and consequently
the plants wilt.

Introduction to Hydrology
7. Available Water : The difference between the field capacity and
permanent wilting point is called available water, the moisture for
plant growth.
8.
Depression Storage : Refer Q. 1.19, Page 1-25C, Unit-1.
9.
Interception : Refer Q. 1.19, Page 1-25C, Unit-1.
10. Infiltration Capacity : The maximum rate at which a given soil at a
given time can absorb water is defined as the infiltration capacity. It is
designated as fp and is expressed in units of cm/h. The actual rate of
infiltration can be expressed as
f = fp when i fp
f = i when i < fp
The infiltration capacity of a soil is high at the beginning of a storm and
has an exponential decay as the time elapses.
11. Infiltration Rate : Infiltration rate, at any instant is the rate at which
water actually enters into the soil during a storm, and is equal to the
infiltration capacity fp or the rainfall rate, whichever is less.
12. Pan Coefficient : The evaporation observed from a pan has to be
corrected to get the evaporation from a lake under similar climatic and
exposure condition thus a co-efficient is introduced as,
Lake evaporation = Cp pan evaporation.
where,
Cp = Pan co-efficient.
The values of Cp in use for different pans are given in Table 1.24.1.

Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
1-35 C (CE-Sem-4)
ii.
The plants grown in the lysimeter are the same as in the surrounding
field.
iii.
Evapotranspiration is estimated in terms of the amount of water
required to maintain constant moisture conditions within the tank
measured either volumetrically or gravimetrically through an
arrangement made in the lysimeter.
iv. Lysimeters should be designed accurately to reproduce the soil
conditions. moisture content, type and size of the vegetation of the
surrounding area.
T.
They should be so buried that the soil is at the same level inside and
outside the container.
vi
Lysimeter studies are time consuming and expensive.
2
Field Plots :
i
Is special plots all the elements of the water-budget in a known
interval of time are measured and the evapotranspiration determined as,
Evapotranspiration = Precipitation + Irrigation input - Runoff -
Increase in soil storage - Groundwater loss
E
Measurements are usually confined to precipitation, irrigation input,
surface runoff and soil moisture.
iii.
Groundwater loss due to deep percolation is difficult to measure and
can be minimized by keeping the moisture condition of the plot at the
field capacity.

Answer
A.
Infiltration Capacity : Refer Q. 1.24, Page 1-32C, Unit-1.
B.
Features : The main features that influence the infiltration are
:
1.
The soil type (texture, structure, hydrodynamic characteristics). The
soil characteristics influence capillary forces and adsorption.
2.
The soil coverage. Vegetation has positive influence on infiltration
by increasing the time of water penetration in soil.
3.
The topography and morphology of slopes.
4.
The flow supply (rain intensity, irrigation flow).
5.
The initial condition of soil humidity. Soil humidity is an important
factor of infiltration regime. The infiltration regime evolves differently
in time for dry or wet soils.

AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
Horton's Equation and Curve Component : Refer Q. 1.31,
Page 1-39C, Unit-1.
1.
Infiltration Index : It is the average rate of loss such that the
volume of rainfall in excess of that rate will be equal to the direct
runoff. Estimate of runoff volume from large areas having
heterogeneous infiltration loss and rainfall characteristics, are made
by use of infiltration indices.
2.
d-index :
i.
The d-index is the average rainfall above which the rainfall volume is
equal to the runoff volume.
ii.
The d-index is derived from the rainfall hyetograph with the knowledge
of the resulting runoff volume.
iii.
The initial loss is also considered as infiltration.
iv.
The d-value is found by treating it as a constant infiltration capacity.
3.
W-index :
i.
In an attempt to refine the 0-index, the initial losses are separated
from the total abstractions and an average value of infiltration rate,
called W-index, is defined as,
P-R-Ie
W =
(1.33.1)
where,
P = Total storm precipitation (cm).
R = Total storm runoff (cm).
1, = Initial losses (cm).
a
te = Duration of the rainfall excess, i.e., the total
time in which the rainfall intensity is greater
than W (in hours).
W = Defined average rate of infiltration (cm).
ii.
Since initial losses are difficult to obtain, the accurate estimation of
W-index is rather difficult.
iii. The minimum value of the W-index obtained under very wet soil
conditions, representing the constant minimum rate of infiltration
of the catchment, is known as W
min'

Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 2.1.
Define runoff and discuss the types of runoff.
Answer
Runoff:
1.
Runoff means the draining or flowing off of precipitation from a
catchment area through a surface channel.
2.
It represents the output from the catchment in a given unit of time.
Types of Runoff : Based on the time delay between the precipitation
and the runoff, the runoff is classified into two categories as :
1.
Direct Runoff:
i.
It is that part of the runoff which enters into the stream immediately
after the rainfall.
ii.
It includes surface runoff, prompt interflow and rainfall on the surface
of the stream.
iii.
In the case of snow-melt, the resulting flow entering into the stream
is also a direct runoff.
iv.
Sometimes terms such as direct storm runoff and storm runoff are
used to designate direct runoff.
2
Base Flow :
i.
The delayed flow that reaches to a stream essentially as groundwater
flow is called base flow.
ii.
Many times delayed interflow is also included under this category.
iii.
In the annual hydrograph of a perennial stream, the base flow is
easily recognized as the slowly decreasing flow of the stream in rainless
periods.

Answer
A study of the annual hydrographs of streams enables one to classify
streams into three classes as :
1.
Perennial Stream :
i.
A perennial stream is one which always carries some flow in it Fig. 2.2.1.
ii.
There is considerable amount of groundwater flow throughout the year.
iii. Even during the dry seasons the watertable will be above the bed of the
stream.

Intermittent Stream :
i.
An intermittent stream has limited contribution from the groundwater.
ii.
During the wet season the watertable is above the stream bed and there
is a contribution of the base flow to the stream flow.
iii.
However, during dry seasons the watertable drops to a level lower than
that of the stream bed and the stream dries up.
iv.
Excepting for an occasional storm which can produce a short-duration
flow, the stream remains dry for the most part of the dry months
(Fig. 2.2.2).

Que 2.4.
What is runoff ? What are the factors that affect the
runoff from a catchment area ? Describe the methods of computing
runoff from a catchment area.
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 10
Answer
Runoff : Refer Q. 2.1, Page 2-2C, Unit-2.
Factors : Following are the factors that affect the runoff from a
catchment area :
1.
Precipitation Characteristics :
i.
This is the most important factor on which runoff depends. Important
precipitation characteristics are :
a.
Intensity.
b. Duration.
c.
Aerial distribution.
d. Direction of storm movement.
e.
Form of precipitation.
f. Evapo-transpiration.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-6 C (CE-Sem-8)
Runoff and Hydrographs
ii.
More the rainfall more will be the runoff. Runoff depends on the type of
the storm causing precipitation, and also upon its duration.
iii.
Runoff also increases wit the intensity of rainfall. Runoff also increases
with the extent of the st rm over the catchment.
iv.
If the rainfall intensity is very less, and it rains as light showers, much of
the water will be lost in infiltration and evaporation etc., and the runoff
will be less. Greater evapo-transpiration will result in lesser runoff.
v.
Similarly, if the precipitation is in the form of snow, or if water freezes
as it falls, it will be retained in the catchment till temperature increases.
Thus runoff will be less.
2
Shape and Size of the Catchment :
i.
The runoff from a catchment also depends upon the size, shape and
location of the catchment.
ii.
More intense rainfalls are generally distributed over a relatively smaller
area A stream collecting water from a small catchment area is likely to
give greater runoff intensity per unit area.
iii.
In the case of a very big catchment, uniform rain seldom falls over the
entire area, with the result that only very few tributaries of the stream
feed water to main stream during a particular storm.
iv.
Thus runoff intensity of larger stream, per unit catchment area is lesser.
v.
In the case of a fan or sector shaped catchment Fig. 2.4.1(a) all the
tributaries are approximately of the same size.
vi.
Such catchment gives greater runoff since the peak flood from the
tributaries is likely to reach the main stream approximately at the same
time.
vii. In the case of a fern leaf catchment Fig. 2.4.1(b), the tributaries are
generally of different lengths, and meet the main stream at the regular
intervals.

Fig. 2.4.1. Effect of shape of the catchment.
3.
Topography of Catchment :
i.
The runoff depends upon whether the surface of the catchment is smooth
or rugged.
ii.
If the surface slope is steep, water will flow quickly, and absorption and
evaporation losses will be less, resulting in greater runoff.
Scanned with CamScanner
Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
2-7C (CE-Sem-8)
iii. If the catchment is mountainous, and is on the windward side of the
mountains, the intensity of rainfall will be more, and hence runoff will
also be more.
4.
Orientation of Watershed :
i.
The orientation of watershed affects the evaporation and transpiration
loss by influencing the amount of heat received from the sun.
ii.
The north and south orientation of watershed affects the melting time
of collected snow and hence the runoff.
iii.
Similarly, in mountainous watershed, the windward side of the mountain
receives comparatively higher intense rainfall than the leeward side.

OR
Describe the analysis of the recession limb of a flood hydrograph.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 05
Answer
A.
Hydrograph : A plot of the discharge in a stream plotted against time
chronologically is called a hydrograph.
B. Components of Hydrograph : The essential components of a
hydrograph are described below :
1.
Rising Limb :
i.
The rising limb of a hydrograph, also known as concentration curve
represents the increase in discharge due to the gradual building up of
storage in channels and over the catchment surface.
ii.
The initial losses and high infiltration losses during the early period of
a storm cause the discharge to rise rather slowly in the initial periods.
iii.
As the storm continues, more and more flow from distant parts reach
the basin outlet.

in. The storage of water in the basin exists as (i) surface storage, which
includes both surface detention and channel storage, (ii) interflow
storage, and (iii) groundwater storage, i.e., base-flow storage.
Que 26. What do you mean by design flood ? What are the factors
affecting the flood hydrograph ?
Answer
A Design Flood : It is the value of the instantaneorus peak discharge
adopted for the design of a particular project or any of its structure. The
term derign flood is used to denote the maximum flood flow that could
be passed without damage or serious threat to the stability of engineering
structure.
B. Factors : Following are the factors affecting the flood hydrograph :
1.
Physiographic Factors :
i
Basin characteristics:
a Shape.
b. Size.
c. Slope.
d Nature of the valley.
e. Elevation.
f. Drainage density.
ii.
Infiltration characteristics: :
a
Land une and cover.
b. Soil type and geological conditions.
c.
Lakes, swamps and other storage.
iii.
Channel chaaracteritics : Cross-section, roughness, and storage capacity.
2
Climatic Factors :
i.
Storm characteristics: Precipitation, intensity, duration, magnitude,
and movement of storm.
ii.
Initial lona.
iii. Evapotranmpiration.
a.
Shape of the Basin :
i.
The shape of the basin influences the time taken for water from the
remote parts of the catchment to arrive at the outlet. Thus, the occurrence
of the peak and hence the shape of the hydrograph are affected by the
basin shape.
ii. Fan-shaped, i.e., nearly semi circular shaped catchments give high
peak and narrow hydrographs while elongated catchments give broad
and low-peaked hydrographa.
4.
Size
i.
Small basins behave different from the large ones in terms of the
relative importance of various phasen of the runoff phenomenon.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-10 C (CE-Sem-8)
Runoff and Hydrographs
ii.
In small catchments, the overland flow phase is predominant over the
channel flow.
iii.
Hence the land use and intensity of rainfall have important role on
the peak flood. On large basins these effects are suppressed as the
channel flow phase is more predominant.
5.
Slope :
i.
The slope of the main stream controls the velocity of flow in the
channel.
ii.
As the recession limb of the hydrograph represents the depletion of
storage, the stream channel slope will have a pronounced effect on
this part of the hydrograph.
iii.
Large stream slopes give rise to quicker depletion of storage and
hence result in steeper recession limbs of hydrographs.
iv.
The basin slope is important in small catchments where the overland
flow is relatively more important. In such cases the steeper slope of
the catchment results in larger peak discharges.
6.
Drainage Density :
i.
The drainage density is defined as the ratio of the total channel length
to the total drainage area.
ii.
A large drainage density creates situation conducive for quick disposal
of runoff down the channels.
iii.
This fast response is reflected in a pronounced peaked discharge.
iv.
In basins with smaller drainage densities, the overland flow is predominant
and the resulting hydrograph is squat with a slowly rising limb.
7.
Climatic Factors :
i.
Among climatic factors the intensity, duration, and direction of storm
movement are the three important ones affecting the shape of a flood
hydrograph.
ii.
For a given duration, the peak and volume of the surface runoff are
essentially proportional to the intensity of rainfall.
iii.
This aspect is made use of in the unit hydrograph theory of estimating
peak-flow hydrographs.

Straight Line Method :
1.
In this method, the separation of the base flow is achieved by joining
with a straight line the beginning of the surface runoff to a point on the
recession limb representing the end of the direct runoff.
2.
In Fig. 2.7.1, point A represents the beginning of the direct runoff and it
is usually easy to identify in view of the sharp change in the runoff rate
at that point.

Point B, marking the end of the direct runoff is rather difficult to locate

peak to the point B is
N=0.83A02
where,
A = Drainage area in km²
4.
Points A and B are joined by a straight line to demarcate to the base flow
and surface runoff.
5.
It should be realized that the value of N obtained as above is only
approximate and the position of B should be decided by considering a
number of hydrographs for the catchment.

Runoff and Hydrographs
OR
Discuss the several assumptions underlying the UH method in
hydrological analysis.
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 10
Answer
A Unit Hydrograph :
1.
A unit hydrograph (or unit-graph) is the direct runoff hydrograph
resulting from one centimeter (or one millimeter or one inch) of excess
rainfall generated uniformly over a catchment area at a constant rate
for an effective duration.
2
The unit hydrograph for a catchment basin is the direct runoff
hydrograph produced by a unit (usually 1 cm) rainfall excess from a
storm of D-hour duration and therefore, is the lumped response of the
basin to the storm.
B. Assumptions : Following are the basic assumptions in the unit
hydrograph theory :
1 The excess rainfall has a constant intensity (1/D cm/hr) within effective
storm duration of D-hours.
2
The excess rainfall (giving rise to 1 cm depth of runoff) is uniformly
distributed throughout the entire catchment basin.
3. The base time of direct runoff hydrograph (i.e., the duration of the
direct runoff resulting from an excess rainfall of given duration) is
constant.
4 The ordinates of all direct runoff hydrographs of a common base
time are directly proportional to the total amount of direct runoff
represented by each hydrograph.
5.
For a given catchment basin, the hydrograph, resulting from a given
excess rainfall reflects the unchanging characteristics of the catchment
basin.
Que 29.

uses. A 12-hr UH of a catchment is triangular in the shape with a

magnitudes for use in the design of hydraulic structures.
2
It is TESE in extension of flood-flow records based on rainfall records.

A. Hydrograph : Refer Q. 2.5, Page 2-7C, Unit-2.
B. Theory of Unit Hydrograph : Refer Q. 2.8, Page 2-11C, Unit-2.
C. Limitations of Unit Hydrograph : Following are the limitations to
the use of unit hydrographs :
1.
Precipitation must be from rainfall only. Snow-melt runoffcannot be
satisfactory represented by unit hydrograph.
2.
The catchment should not have unusually large storages in terms of
tanks, ponds, large flood-bank storages, etc., which affect the linear
relationship between storage and discharge.
3.
If the precipitation is decidedly non-uniform, unit hydrographs can
not be expected to give good results.
4.
In the use of unit hydrographs very accurate results should not be
expected. Variations in the hydrograph base of as much as 1 20 % and
in the peak discharge by = 10 % are normally considered acceptable.

AKTU 2016-17, 2017-18; Marks 10
Answer
A Design Flood and Factors : Refer a 2.6, Page 2-3C, Unit- 2.
B. Procedure The unit hydrograph is known and the design storm is
assumed, we proceed as follows
:
1.
Plot the assumed design storm as a bar diagram with the unit hydrograph
duration as the time interval. For example, storm of 16-hour duration
will be represented as four rainfall intervals of four hours each, if a
4-hour unit hydrograph is given.
2.
Subtract the infiltration losses to obtain effective precipitation.
3.
Applying linearity and superposition principles, obtain hydrographs
corresponding to each storm interval by multiplying the unit hydrograph
ordinater by the precipitation depths during the interval.
4.
Add the ordinates of the hydrographs corresponding to each time interval
to obtain the direct runoff hydrograph for the composite storm.
5.
Add the entimated base flow to get the anticipated flood hydrograph.

Answer
Given : Ordinates of a hydrograph are given in table, Area of
catchment, A = 450 km².
To Find : The ordinates of 6-h unit hydrograph.
1.
Let us assume a constant base flow of 5 curnecs.
2.
The ordinates of direct runoff hydrograph are obtained by subtracting
base flow (= 5 curnecs) from each ordinate of the given flood hydrograph,
as given in the Table. 2.14.1.

When 2 unit hydrographs, each of 4-hr duration, are added together
placed at 4-hr lag successively from one another, then we will get the
ordinates of 8-hr.
2
Surface runoff hydrograph, containing 2 cm of direct runoff. Hence
the ordinates of a 8-hr unit hydrograph are obtained by dividing each
of the ordinates of 8-hr hydrograph by 2.

Explain the concept of S-hydrograph and under what
circumstances you would adoption of this hydrograph. Give a clear

AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
Method of Construction of Unit Hydrograph
:
1.
Ideally, unit hydrographs are derived from simple isolated storms and
if the duration of the various storms do not differ very much, say
within a band of = 20 % D, they would all be grouped under one
average duration of D-h.
2.
If in practical applications unit hydrographs of different durations are
needed they are best derived from field data.
3.
Lack of adequate data normally precludes development of unit
hydrographs covering a wide range of durations for a given catchment.
4.
Under such conditions a D-hour unit hydrograph is used to develop
unit hydrographs of differing duration nD.
5.
Two methods are available for this purpose :
i.
Method of Superposition :
If a D-h unit hydrograph is available, and it is desired to develop
a
a unit hydrograph of nD-h, where n is an integer, it is easily
accomplished by superposing n unit hydrographs with each graph
separated from the previous on by D-h. Fig. 2.16.1 shows three
4h unit hydrographs A, B and C.
Curve B begins 4 h after A and C begins 4-h, after B.
b.
Thus the combination of these three curves is a DRH of 3 cm due
to an excess rainfall (ER) of 12-h duration. If the ordinates of this
DRH are now divided by 3, one obtains a 12-h unit hydrograph.
The calculations are easy if performed in a tabular form.

ii. The S-curve :
a.
If it is desired to develop a unit hydrograph of duration mD,
where m is a fraction, the method of superposition cannot be
used.
b.
A different technique known as the S-curve method is adopted in
such cases, and this method is applicable for rational values of m.
c.
The S-curve, also known as S-hydrograph is a hydrograph produced
by a continuous effective rainfall at a constant rate for an infinite
period.
d.
It is a curve obtained by summation of an infinite series of
D-h unit hydrographs spaced D-h apart.
e.
'Fig. 2.16.2 shows such a series of D-h hydrograph arranged with
their starting points D-h apart.
f.
At any given time the ordinates of the various curves occurring
at that time coordinate are summed up to obtain ordinates of the
S-curve.
g.
A smooth curve through these ordinates result in an S-shaped
curve called S-curve.

This S-curve is due to a D-h unit hydrograph. It has an initial
steep portion and reaches a maximum equilibrium discharge at a
time equal to the time base of the first unit hydrograph.
i.
The average intensity of ER producing the S-curve is 1/D cm/h
and the equilibrium discharge,

where, A = Area of the catchment in km², and D = Duration in
hours of ER of the unit hydrograph used in deriving the S-curve.
Alternatively,
= A D
where, A is in the km², and D is in h.
j.
The quantity R. represents the maximum rate at which an ER
intensity of 1/D cm/h can drain out of a catchment of area A. In
actual construction of an S-curve, it is found that the curve oscillates
in the top portion at around the equilibrium value due to
magnification and accumulation of small errors in the hydrograph.
When it occurs, an average smooth curve is drawn such that it
reaches a value Q, at the time base of the unit hydrograph.

At, t = 4 hours; Ordinate of 4-h UH = 4 m'sec
S-curve addition = Ordinate of 4-h UH @ 11 = (4 - 4) = 0 hours) = 0
Hence S-curve ordinate = 4 + () = 4 m B/sec
4.
At,  = 8 hours; Ordinate of 4-h UH = 12 m³/sec
S-curve addition= Ordinate of 4-h UH @ u - (8 - 4) - 4 hour /=4 m³/sec
Hence S-curve ordinate - 12 + 4 - 16 m³/sec

At, t = 12 hours; Ordinate of 4-h UH = 6 m³/sec

How will you derive the synthetic unit hydrograph from a number
of unit hydrograph ? Illustrate the method with suitable example
in a tabular form.
AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
A.
Synthetic Unit Hydrograph :
1.
We have seen that if the rainfall and runoff records are available, unit
hydrographs can be derived.
2.
However, in the case of ungauged rivers, these data are not available.
In some other cases, the data available may be scanty.
3.
For such catchments, unit hydrographs are derived by relating the
selected basin characteristics to the unit hydrograph shape.
4.
The resulting hydrograph, derived from basin characteristies
relationship is known as a synthetic unit hydrograph.
B.
Snyder's Method :
1.
Snyder studied the data of catchments of Appalachian Highlands of
Eastern United States, and then developed empirical equations for
synthetic hydrograph.
2.
Snyder selected three parameters of unit hydrograph :
i.
Base width, Tb
ii.
Peak discharge, Qp
iii.
Basin lag, tz.

The equations given by him take into account catchment area, shape
of basin, topography, channel slopes, stream density and channel
storage.
Scanned with CamScanner
(CE-Sem-S)
Runoff and Hydrographs
4
He eliminated all these parameters except the first two. by including
them in a single co-efficient C.
5
He dealt with the suse and shape of the catchment by measuring the
length of the main stream channel. by proposing the following equation
for basin lag
: = CA, x LIRS
-
(2.21.1)
where,
I = Basin lag in hours, (basin lag is the time
between mass of centre of unit rainfall of T
hour duration and runoff peak flow)
C. = A co-efficient depending upon units and
11
drainage basin characteristics (1.35 - 1.65).
L = Distance from station to catchment boundary
1'
measured along the main stream, in km.
Lee = Distance along the main stream from gauging
station to a point opposite the centroid of the
watershed. in km.
6.
The peak discharge of Q, unit hydrograph of standard duration T is
given by,
R,=2.77CC,A =
(2.21.2)
where,
Qp = Peak discharge (m³/sec).
A = Catchment area (km²).
Cp = A regional constant, ranging from 0.56 to 0.69.
7.
Snyder adopted the standard duration (T) hours of effective rainfall
given by,
T = = (2/11)tL
(2.21.3)
8.
The duration of surface runoff or the base length Tb of unit hydrograph
is given by,
Tc=3+3(24)(days)
=
+
When Tb is expressed in hours,
Tb ==72+341 =
(2.21.4)
(where both T and 11. are in hours)
9.
It is found that equation (2.21.4) gives unreasonably long base periods
for small catchments. Some investigators recommend that a base period
equal to five times the time to peak should be taken :
Tb = T
or
T, = 5.455 11
(2.21.5)
Alternatively, assuming a triangular shape of unit hydrograph,
T, = 5.556/4p
10. Sketching of unit hydrographs becomes easier by adopting the following
recommendations given by US Army Corps of Engineers, for widths of
unit hydrographs at 50 and 75% of the pent 11--

where,

= Width of unit hydrograph in hours, at 50 % peak discharge.
W75 = Width of unit hydrograph, in hours, at 75 % peak discharge.
9p = Qp / A = Peak discharge per unit area.
11. Usually, one third of this width is kept before the unit hydrograph
peak and two thirds after the peak.

A
Synthetie Unit Hydrograph : Refer Q. 2.21, Page 2-26C, Unit-2.
B.
Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) :
1.
For a given catchment a number of unit hydrographs of different
durations are possible.
2.
The shape of these different unit hydrographs depend upon the value
of D.
3.
Fig. 122.1 shows a typical variation of the shape of unit hydrographs
for different values of D. As D is reduced, the intensity of rainfall
excess being equal to 1/D increases and the unit hydrograph becomes
more skewed. A finite unit hydrograph is indicated as the duration
D
0.
The limiting case of a unit hydrograph of zero duration is known as
instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUHD. Thus IUH is a fictitious, conceptual
unit hydrigraph which represents the surface runoff from the catchment
due to an instantaneous precipitation of the rainfall excess volume of
1 em. IUH is designated as u(t) or sometimes as u(D, ").

Que 3.1.
Explain the rational methods of computing the peak
ischarge of a small catchment. Where this method is commonly
sed and what are its merits and demerits ? Also discuss the runoff
o-efficient C of the rational formula.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 10
Answer
Rational Methods :
Amongst various types of empirical relations, rational formula is the
most rational method of calculating peak discharge for small
catchments.
In this method, it is assumed that the maximum flood flow is produced
by a certain rainfall intensity which lasts for a time equal to or greater
than the period of concentration time (td)
The maximum rate of runoff from the watershed appears when the
entire area contributes at the basin outlet.
The runoff gradually increases from zero to peak when the rainfall
duration reaches the time of concentration (t). If the rainfall continues
beyond tor the runoff will be constant and at the peak value.
The peak value of runoff is given by,
Qp = Fu CiA
where,
C = Runoff co-efficient representing a ratio of runoff to
rainfall.
A = Catchment area in km².
i = Rainfall intensity in cm/hour.
Fr u = A factor which permits the expression of terms Qp A and i
in consistent units.
Qp = Discharge in cubic meters per second (cumecs).
In order to find corresponding value of factor Fu. we have
i
CiA
Qn=(106A(C)
=
= 2.778 CiA
100 X 3600
0.36
ii.
Hence, factor Fu = 2.778
If, however, i is expressed in mm/hour, we have

Describe the term derign storm. How is it determined?
Anewer
Derign Storm :
1
To entimate the design Baxt for a project by the use of a unit hydrogragk,
one needs the derign storm.
2. This can be the storm-producing probable mazimum precipitation
(PMP) for deriving PMF or a standard project storm (SPS) for
calculations.
3. The computations are performed by experienced
by using meteorological data Various methods ranging from highly
sophisticated bydrometeorological methods to simple analysis of part
rainfall data are in use depending on the availability of reliable relevant
data and expertise.
4.
The following is a brief outline of a procedure followed in India:
i.
The duration of the critical rainfall is first selected. This will be the of
basin lag if the flood peak is of interest. If the flood volume is the
prime interest, the duration of the longest storm experienced in
basin is selected.
ii
Past major storms in the region which conceivably could have occurred
in the basin under study are selected. DAD analysis is performed
and the enveloping curve representing maximum depth-duration
relation for the study basin obtained.
iii.
Rainfall depths for convenient time intervals (e.g., 6 h) are scaled to
get a critical sequence which produces the maximum flood peak
from the enveloping curve. These increments are to be arranged
when applied to the relevant unit hydrograph of the basin.
iv.
The critical sequence of rainfall increments can be
and error. Alternatively, increments of precipitation are
in a table of relevant unit hydrograph ordinates, such that :
a.
The maximum rainfall increment is against the maximum unit
hydrograph ordinate.
b.
The second highest rainfall increment is against the second largest
unit hydrograph ordinate, and so on.
c.
The sequence of rainfall increments arranged above is now
reversed, with the last item first and first item last. The new
sequence gives the design storm.
v.
The design storm is then combined with hydrologic abstractions most
conductive to high runoff, viz., low initial loss and lowest infiltration
rate to get the hyetograph of rainfall excess to operate upon the unit
hydrograph.

Explain the term risk, reliability videty farture.
Answer
in
Risk and Reliability =
2
The derigner of 2 hydraulic structure always fees z nagging donst
about the risk of failure of his structure.
2
This is because the estimation of the bydrologic derize Table (stach
as the design food discharge and the river stage during the desize
flood) involve a natural or intruit uncertainty and 25 soch E hydrological
risk of failure.
3. The probability of occurrence of an event (x277) at least once over
a period of n successive years is called the risk, P. Thus, the risk is
given by,
R = 1 (Probability of of the event = 227 in n yeers)
R = 1 (1
where, P = Probability P(zzIn= T =Return period.
4.
The reliability R. is definedas
R,=1-R=(2-4) = 1 R =
5. It can be seen that the return period for which a structure should be
designed depends upon the acceptable level of risk. In practice, the
acceptable risk is governed by economic and policy considerations.
B. Safety Factor :
1.
In addition to the hydrological uncertainty, as mentioned above, a
water resource development project will have many other uncertainties.
2.
These may arise out of structural, constructional. operational and
environmental causes as well as from non-technological considerations
such as economic, sociological and political causes.
3.
As such, any water resource development project will have a safety
factor for a given hydrological parameter M as defined below.

Define flood routing. Discuss broad categories of routing.
Answer
Flood Routing : It is the technique of determining the flood hydrograph
at a section of a river by utilizing the data of flood flow at one or more
upstream sections.
In these applications two broad categories of routing can be recognized.
Those are :

In eq. 3.15.1) all the terms in the left-hand side are known at the

of a time step A. Hence the value of the function (s, + QAI
at the end of the time step is calculated by equation (3.15.1).
iv. Since the relation S = S(h) and Q = Q(h) are known, + 2 will
enable one to determine the reservoir elevation and hence
the
discharge at the end of the time step. The procedure is repeated to
cover the full inflow hydrograph.
V.
For practical use in hand computation, the following semi-graphical
method is very convenient :
a
From the known storage-elevation and discharge-elevation data,
prepare a curve of (s + 2 elevation. Here, any
vs. At is chosen
interval, approximately 20 to 40 % of the time of rise of the
inflow hydrograph.
b.
On the same plot prepare a curve of outflow discharge vs. elevation.

Answer
Hydrologie Channel Routing :
1 In reservoir routing, the storage was a unique function of the outflow B
discharge, S = AQ). However, in channel routing
function of both outflow and inflow discharges and a
routing method is needed.
2
The flow in a river during a flood belongs to the category of
varied unsteady flow. The water surface in a channel
only paraliel to the channel bottom but also varies with time
(Fig. 3.17.1).

Wedge Storage :
a. It is the wedge-like volume formed between the actual water
surface profile and the top surface of the prism storage.
b.
At a fixed depth, at a downstream section of a river reach, the
prism storage is constant while the wedge storage changes from
a positive value at an advancing flood to a negative value during
a receding flood.
c.
The prism storage Sp is similar to a reservoir and can be expressed
as a function of the outflow discharge, Sp = F(Q).
d.
The wedge storage can be accounted for by expressing it as
Su = /\I).
e.
The total storage in the channel reach can then be expressed as,
S = K
(3.17.1)
where, K and x are coefficients and m = A constant exponent.
f.
It has been found that the value of m varies from 0.6 for rectangular
channels to a value of about 1.0 for natural channels.
Muskingum Equation :
Using m - 1.0, eq. (3.17.1) reduces to a linear relationship for S in
terms of I and Q as,
Scanned with CamScanner

S = K [x I + (1 - x) Q1
and this relationship is known as the Muskingum equation.
(3.17.2)
2.
In this the parameter x is known as weighting factor and takes
value between o and 0.5.
a
3.
When X = 0, obviously the storage is a function of discharge only and
eq. (3.17.2) reduces to
S = KQ
(3.17.3)
Such storage is known as linear storage or linear reservoir.
4.
When x = 0.5, both the inflow and outflow are equally important in
determining the storage.

Answer
A.
Flood Control: The term flood control is commonly used to denote all
the measures adopted to reduce damages to life and property by floods.
Structural Methods : Following are the structural method
:
1.
Storage Reservoir :
i.
Storage reservoirs offer one of the most reliable and effective methods
of flood control,
ii.
Ideally, in this method, a part of the storage in the reservoir is kept
apart to absorb the incoming flood.
iii. Further, the stored water is released in a controlled way over an
extended time NO that downstream channels do not get flooded.
iv. Fig. 3.18.1 shows un ideal operating plan of a flood control reservoir.

2 Levees :
i.
Levees, also known as dikes or flood embankments are earthen
banks constructed parallel to the course of the river to confine it to a
fixed course and limited cross-sectional width.
ii.
Masonry structures used to confine the river in a manner similar to
levees are known as flood walls. These are used to protect important
structures against floods, especially where the land is at a premium.
iii. The heights of levees will be higher than the design flood level with
sufficient free board.
iv. The confinement of the river to a fixed path frees large tracts of land
from inundation and consequent damage.
v.
Levees are one of the oldest and most common methods of flood-
protection works adopted in the world. Also, they are probably the
cheapest of structural flood-control measures.
vi.
While the protection offered by a levee against flood damage is obvious,
what is not often appreciated is the potential damage in the event of
a levee failure.
vii. The design of a levee is a major task in which costs and economic
benefits have to be considered.
viii. The cross-section of a levee will have to be designed like an earth
dam for complete safety against all kinds of saturation and drawdown
possibilities.
3. Floodways :
i.
Floodways are natural channels into which a part of the flood will be
diverted during high stages.
ii.
A floodway can be a natural or manmade channel and its location is
controlled essentially by the topography.
iii.
Generally, wherever they are feasible, floodways offer an economical
alternative to other structural flood-control mensures.

area
in
Reduction of the channel roughness, by clearing of vegetation from
the channel perimeter
Short circuiting of meander loops by cutoff channels, leading to
increased slopes.
5.
Watershed Management :
i
Watershed management and land treatment in the catchment aims
at cutting down and delaying the runoff before it gets into the river.
is
Watershed management measures include developing the vegetative
and soil cover in conjunction with land treatment words like Nalabunds,
check dams, contour bunding. zing terraces etc.
iii.
There measures are towards improvement of water infiltration capacity
of the soil and reduction of soil erosion.
iv. Watershed treatment is now a day's an integral part of flood
management.
v.
It is believed that while small and medium floods are reduced by
watershed management measures, the magnitude of extreme floods
are unlikely to be affected by these measures.

Floods in these rivern occur during monacon months and usually in the
months of August or September. The damagea caumed by flonda are

iii.
During 1953-2004, the average number of human liven and cattle lost
due to floods in the country were 1597 and 94,000 respectively
iv. It is estimated that annually, on an average about 40 Mha of land in
liable to flooding and of this about 14 Mha have some kind of flood
control measures.
v.
At the beginning of the current millennium, in the country, as per finod
control measures, there were about 15800 km of levees and about 32000
km of drainage channel affording protection from floods.
vi. On an average, about. 7.5 Mha land is affected by flood annually. Out of
this, about 3.56 Mha are landa under crops.
vii.
Similarly, annually about 3.345 lakhs people are affected and about
12.15 lakhs houses are damaged by flood. On an average. about 60-80 %
of flood damages occur in the state U.P., Bihar, West Bengal. Assam and
Odisha.
viii. Flood forecasting is handled by CWC. The CWC has 157 flood forecasting
stations, of which 132 stations are for river stage forecast and 25 for

Que 3.20.
What is meant by the term flood forecasting and
warning? Describe the various flood forecasting techniques.
Answer
A.
Flood Forecasting and Warning :
1.
Forecasting of floods sufficiently in advance enables a warning to be
given to the people likely to be affected and further enables civil
authorities to take appropriate precautionary measures.
2.
It thus forms a very important and relatively inexpensive non-structural
flood management measure.
3.
However, it must be realized that a flood warning is meaningful only
if it is given sufficiontly in advance.
4.
Further, erroneous warnings will cause the populace to lose confidence
and faith in the system. Thus the dual requirements of reliability and
advance notice are the essential ingredients of a flood forecasting
system.
Flood Forecasting Techniques : The flood forecasting techniques
can be broadly divided into three categories :

number of elements and partial differential equations are integrated
at the nodal points of the elements.
V. The numerical schemes are further classified into explicit and implicit
methods.
vi In the explicit method the algebraie equations are linear and the
dependent variables are extracted explicitly at the end of each time
step.
In the implicit method, the dependent variables occur implicitly and
the equations are nonlinear.
Each of these two methods has a host of finite -differencing schemes

A special case of unconfined aquifer is known as perched aquifer, is
formed when infiltrated rain water is intercepted within the zone of
aeration by an impermeable layer and a local zone of saturation is formed.
The upper surface of such local zone of saturation is known as perched
watertable.
The perched aquifer occurs at higher elevation than the regional
watertable.
Confined Aquifers (Artesian aquifers) :
It is the one which is overlain by an impermeable layer or an aquiclude.
Unlike the unconfined aquifer, the water in the confined aquifer is not

Answer
Forms of Subsurface Water : The underground water is generally
available in the following forms :
1.
Infiltration Galleries :
i
These are horizontal or nearly horizontal tunnels constructed at shallow
depths (3 to 5 metres) along the bank of the river through the water
bearing strata, as shown in Fig. 1.4.1. They are sometimes called
horizontal wells.
ii.
These galleries are generally constructed of masonry walls with roof
slabs, and derive their water from the aquifer by various porous drain
pipes.
iii.
These pipes are generally covered with gravel, so as to prevent the
entry of the fine sand particles into the pipe.

Answer
Typen of Tubewells: Following are the various types of tubewells :
1.
Strainer Type Tubewell :
1.
The strainer well la the most common and widely used well. In common
term, the word "tube well" refers to the strainer type: of tube well.
ii.
In this type of well, a strainer, which in a special type of wire mesh, is
wrapped round the main tube of the well.
iii.
The main pipe contains bigger holes or slote than the openings of the
strainer.
iv.
The total area of the openings of the tube is kept equal to the openings
of the strainer no that the velocity of flow does not change.
v.
Due to fineness of the openings of the strainer, a higher operational
velocity of water can be permitted.
vi.
Little annular space is left between the strainer and the pipe so that the
open area of pipe perforations is not reduced.

ix.
The pipe in the aquifer portion is kept perforated. In the rest of the
portion. plain or blind pipe is provided.

Cavity Type Tubewcll:
i.
This 18 a special type of tube well in which water is not drawn throug!
the strainer, but it is drawn through the bottom of the well where
cavity 15 formed.
il.
The tube well pipe penetrates a strong clay layer which acts as a strocq

However, is deep well draws from the first aquifer below the mota layer
while is cavity well need not do no.
iv. The commential condition for a cavity tube well to function efficiently is to
have confined aquifer of good specific yield, and the aquifer should have
a strong impervious material above it.
v.
In the initial stage of pumping with the help of a centrifugal pump or at
air lift. pump, fine mand comes with water and consequently a hollov
cavity in formed.
vi. Ax the spherical surface area of cavity increaser outwards, the radial
critical velocity decreases, and the hand particles stop entering the well
vii, At this stage, equilibrium in the cavity formation is established and
clean water continues to enter the well on further pumping at the same
constant discharge.
vili. After the formation of the envity, the velocity of entry of water at the
bottom of the pipe in leaner than the critical,

Sufficient depth of water bearing stratum is not available even
upto a depth of 75 to 100 m, so that strainer type tube well cannot
be used.
b.
Suitable strong roof is not available so that a cavity well cannot be
formed.
ii.
In such a circumstance, a slotted well is used and it is made to penetrate
to some depth in the water bearing strata.
iii. A slotted tube well essentially consists of a slotted tube penetrating
the confined aquifer.
iv.
The size of slots may be 25 mm x 3 mm at 10 to 12 mm spacing. In
order to prevent the fine particles entering the pipe, it is shrouded
with a mixture of gravel and bajri (coarse sand).
Que 4.6.
Write down in details selection of suitable site for a tube
well.
Answer
Selection of the Suitable Site : The following points should be
considered for the selection of the site :
1.
Tube well should be selected at a site where large underground reservoir
exists.
2. If the geological explorations indicate ridges and depressions of
impermeable strata inside the ground, the tube well should be located
where there is the valley.
3.
The area should have an access for the availability of a cheap electric
supply so that motor driven pumps can be fitted with tube wells without
an exorbitant cost.
4.
The area should have a well distributed and uniform demand for
irrigation throughout the year. If the demand is not uniform. tube well
will be idling for some time or has to work inefficiently and thus the cost
for overall irrigation will increase.
5.
The area around the tube well should have an intensive cultivation and
the tube well should be located centrally so as to reduce the length of
gulf and thereby transient losses.
6.
The water available from the tube well should be tested to find out the
irrigation quality of water. If the water is found to have harmful salts,
the site may have to be changed in spite of various advantages.

Write short note on the spherical flow in well.
Answer
Fig. 4.7.1 shows a special case of partially penetrating well, where the
well just penetrates upto the top surface of the semi-infinite porous
medium. In this case, the general equation is not applicable, because the
flow towards the well becomes purely spherical. The discharge R. from
such a well can however be calculated from the equations.

What is the surface of seepage and free surface of curve ?
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 10
Answer
Surface of Seepage and Free Surface Curve :
1.
The surface throughout which the pressure is atmospheric is known as
the free surface.
2.
Let us consider an unconfined aquifer and let AD be the position of the
original free water surface (i.e., the watertable) which is approximately
horizontal.
3.
Let a gravity well of radius rw be constructed throughout the depth of
the aquifer.
4.
Let d be the height from the bottom of the well to the groundwater
table.
5.
Let the water be pumped from this well. After the pumping, the water
will stand in the rest of the bore holes along the lines AB'C'D, there is no
groundwater except capillary moisture.
6.
But according to the Dupuit's formula, the water level in the pumped
well is not found at B'C' level, but at a slightly lower than this level, i.e.,

AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
1. Assumptions of Dupuit's Theory : Dupuit's theory of flow for
unconfined aquifer is based on the following assumptions :
i
The velocity of flow is proportional to the tangent of the hydraulic
gradient instead of sine.
ii.
The flow is horizontal and uniform everywhere in the vertical section.
iii.
Aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic and of infinite areal extent.
iv. The well penetrates and receives water from the entire thickness of
the aquifer.
v.
The coefficient of transmissibility is constant at all places and at all
time.
vi. Natural ground water regime affecting an aquifer remains constant
with time.
vii. Flow is laminar and Darcy's law is applicable.

unconfined aquifers for the determination of discharge with steady
flow condition : A well penetrates into an unconfined aquifer

The aquifer constant T(coefficient of transmissibility) can be determined
by a pumping out test, and by observing drawdown at various observation
wells.
ii.
Pumping must continue at a uniform rate for a sufficient time to approach

Muskat developed solutions for well discharges for various well patterns
localised near the centre of a well field of radius R such that for each
well the head at the external boundary can be taken to be H (i.e., R is the
radius of influence for each well), Fig. 4.23.2.
9.
In the following solutions it is assumed that all the wells fully penetrate
aconfined aquifer, have the same diameter, and drawdown, and discharge
for the same period of time.

The aquifer properties S and T of a confined aquifer in
which a well is driven are known. Explain a procedure to calculate
the drawdown at a location away from the well at any instant after
the pump has started.
AKTU 2018-19, Marks 10
Answer
1.
When a well in a confined aquifer starts discharging. the water from
the aquifer is released resulting in the formation of a cone of depression
of the piezometric surface. This cone gradually expands with time till
equilibrium is attained.
2.

Theis obtained the solution of this equation as :
s = - =
(4.24.2)
4xT u u
where,
s = H - h = Drawdown at a point distance r from the
pumping well.
H = Initial constant piezometric head.
Q = Constant rate of discharge.
T = Transmissibility of the aquifer.
u = A parameter = -2 S/4Tt.
S = Storage coefficient.
t = Time from start of pumping.
4. The integral on the right hand side is called the well function, W(u)
and is given by,
W(u) = e du = - 0.577216 - In u + u - 2.2! u² + 3.3! u³
(4.24.3)
u
-5.
Values of W(u) can be easily calculated by the series eq. (4.24.3) to
the required number of significant digits which rarely exceed 4.
6.
The solution of eq. (4.24.2) to find the drawdown (s) for a given S, T,
r, t and Q can be obtained in a straightforward manner.
7.
For small values of u(u < 0.01), Jacob showed that the calculations
can be considerably simplified by considering only the first two terms
of the series of W(u), eq. (4.24.3). This assumption leads eq. (4.24.2)
to be expressed as :

Define the efficiency of a well.
Answer
Efficiency of Well :
1.
The discharge from a well is approximately proportional to the drawdown
s. The discharge per unit of drawdown was called specific capacity of the
well. This specific capacity will be different for different well designs.
2.
For determining the best drawdown discharge conditions for a well, the
well may be operated under varying drawdown conditions, and a graph
may be plotted between discharge and drawdown (called yield-drawdown
curve) as shown in Fig. 4.25.1.

Fig. 4.25.1. Yield drawdown curve.
3.
The curve obtained is a straight line upto a certain stage of drawdown,
beyond which the drawdown increases disproportionately to the yield.
4.
This places an optimum and efficient limit to the drawdown which may
be allowed to be created in a well.
5.
This is generally found to be 70 % of the maximum drawdown which can
be created in a well.
Que 4.26.
What do you understand by cavity formation in open
well ?
Answer
Cavity formation in Open Well :
1.
Consider a well from which no water is being withdrawn.
2.
The water level in such a well will obviously be the same as is the statie
watertable outside the well.
3.
Now, if a discharge is withdrawn from this well at a constant rate, the
level in the well will go down and stabilize at a lower level than that of
the outside watertable.
4.
The head difference between these two levels is called the depression
head.
5.
Under the influence of this head difference, water enters the well, from
outside, so as to fill the gap created by the withdrawal water.
6.
As the water from the surrounding soil travels towards the well. there
is a gradual loss of head, and water surface drops towards the well.
7.
Since the same discharge is passing through the reducing soil areas as it
approaches the well, there is a gradual increase in the flow velocity can
gradually increase only fthe hydraulic gradient gets gradually increased.
8.
Hence, the water surface will fall gently in the beginning and will fall
more and more rapidly as it approaches the well.
9.
The surface of water table surrounding the well. therefore, takes up a
curved shape and is called the cone of depression.
10.
At. a cortain distance from the central line of the well is called the radius
of influence of the well.
Scanned with CamScanner
4-32 C (CE-Sem-8)
Grount der
11. The velocity of percolating water into the well depends upon the
depression head.
12.
If more amount of water is withdrawal from the well, thereby increasing
the depression head, higher flow velocities will prevail in the vicinity of
well.
13. Thus, at a certain rate of withdrawal, it is very much possible that the
flow velocity may exceed the critical velocity for the soil, thereby causing
the soil particles to lift up.
14. As more and more sand particles are lifted, a hollow is created in the
bottom of the well. resulting in the increased effective area, so that
ultimately. the velocity falls below the critical value and then no further
sand goes out of the well.

What do you understand by image well ?
Answer
Image Well :
1.
Ferris (1959) and Moulder (1963) describe image well theory by which
the influence of hydrogeologic boundaries on aquifer tests can be
determined
2.
Image well theory assumes that the aquifers are of an infinite areal
extent.
3.
An image well is a hypothetical well that simulates recharge or discharge
at the same distance from the hydraulic boundary as the real production
well. In other words, the geologie boundary is replaced by an imaginary
well for analytical purposes.
4.
Both the real production well and the image well are considered to be
operating simultaneously.
5.
In the case of a barrier boundary, the effect on drawdown in the
production well is the same as through the aquifer were of an infinite
extent and a discharge image well were located across the boundary on
a line normal and the same distance from the boundary as the real well.

Answer
Partially Penetrating Artesian Well :
1.
A partially penetrating artesian well is the one in which the well screen
does not penetrate to the full depth of the confined aquifer.
2.
The pattern of flow in the aquifer in the vicinity of such a well deviates
from that for a fully penetrating well.
3.
In practice, we often encounter such wells that extend only part way
through the water bearing strata.
4.
Fig. 4.28.1 shows a partially penetrating artesian well in which the
strainer length B1 is less than the aquifer thickness B.
5.

Well Construction : Well construction usually comprises four or five
dastanct operations drilling. installing the casing, placing a well screen
and fülter pack if required. grouting to provide sanitary protection, and
developing the well to insure sand-free operation at maximum yield.
1.
Drilling Methods:
i
Wells mary be drug. bored. driven. jetted or drilled. Simple drilling methods
like drive porent. jetting. and hand boring can be adopted in favourable
conditions for construction of shallow wells up to 25 cm diameter and
45 m deep
ii
Selection of drilling equipment depends upon the hydrogeology of the
formation distmeter and depth of the production well, availability of
funda maintenance and spares. production capacity, volume of work,
operating CIEF and Mary movement of the rig.

Answer
A.
Well Completion : Well completion operations include:
i.
Grouting and sealing the caring.
ii.
Completion of the top of the well.
iii.
Disinfection of the well.
1.
Grouting the casing means filling the annular space the
of the casing and the inside of the drilled hole with a correct port
2. The grout is a fluid mixture of cement and water of a
that can be forced through the grout. pipes and placed as requared.
3.
Grouting and sealing the casing in water wella serves to prevent the
downward seepage of sewage or other polluted vurface water the
outside of the casing, to seal of aquifer yielding water of your quasity, to
make the casing stay tight in the drilled bole and is form a protective
sheath around the casing against exterior corrosion. thereby
its life.
4.
The top of the casing should normaily extend at least 50 C the
general level of the surrounding surface, well above the food
water levels and isolated from direct contact with accumulating
wastes and sudden drainage discharge.
5.
The space around the casing should be grouted to a depti of 6 =
to seal of the well from the entrance of surface drainage.
6.
A concrete platform should be constructed around the casing at the
ground surface.
7.
The top of the casing should be provided with a sanitary seal consisting
of suitable bushing or packing glands that makes a water-
between the pump column pipe and the well casung
8.
Abandoned wells should be sealed by filling with ciay or cement
grout to avoid possible movement of inferior water from one aquiter to
another and conserve the water in pumped weils.
9.
This is a necessary precaution even The well casings are perforated
only one aquifer, since easings may eventually deteriorate. germitzing
interconnection of ground water bodies.
B. Well Disinfeetion: :
1.
After completion of construction, the well and its appurtenates Like
the casing, pump and pipe systems have to be disinfected or
promptly, for which chlorine solution is the sumpless and effective
agent.
2.
Highly chlorinated water can be prepared by dev calcium
hypochlorite, liquid sodium hypochlonte or gasevus water
3.
A solution containing about 100 ppm of available chlurise should be
used.

4. This can be obtained by adding 125 8 of dry calcium hypochlorite
containing bie chlorine to every 1000 litres of water standing
in the well or about 2 ares of liquid bleach containing 5 % of available
chlorine to every 1000 Litres.
5. A solution is made by mixing this total amount in a small quantity of
water and is poured into the well through the top of the casing, before it
is sealed
6. The water in the well is thoroughly agitated and allowed to stand for
several hours or overnight.

The repeated application of surging force drans the fine particles
the well, leaving coarser particles intact in the aquifer.
Development by Back-Washing:
As the name suggesta it is a process in which the water is made to fow
into the aquifer formation from the well through the screet
IL The ck-washing causes agitation of the formation and breads down
the bridging of aand particles.
Back-washing thus helps in effective retnoval of fine particles.
Development by High Velocity Jetting:
It ie one of the most effective methods of development.
In this method high velocity jets released through the jetting toel pass
through the screen and the formation behund the sereen gets agitated.

ii.
The dispersing agents counteract the property of clay to stick to sand
particles.
III.
The common dispersing agents which are quite effective are various
polyphosphates like tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium
tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate (calgon) and sodium
deptaphosphate.
iv.
Once the dispersing agent neutralises colloidal property of clay it can be
easily removed by surging and back-washing.
C. Recuperation Test :
1.
Though the constant level pumping test gives an accurate value of the
safe vield of an open well. it is sometimes very difficult to regulate the
pump in such a way that constant level is maintained in the well.
2.
In such a circumstance, a recuperation test is resorted to.
3.
In the recuperation test, water level is depressed to any level below the
normal and the pumping is stopped.
4.
The time taken for the water to recuperate to the normal level is noted.

Answer
Following are the equipments used for groundwater:
1.
Plunger Pumps :
i.
Hand pumps with the cylinder at the ground surface or the hollow brass
cylinder lowered below the ground surface (depending upon the
groundwater level) can discharge 20-60 lpm.
ii.
A plunger which is connected to the pump handle rod moves up and
down in the cylinder. It can be hand operated or driven by a 1 or 2 hp
(V-belt driven) motor.
iii.
Pump handles often get broken in constant village use; handles should
be kept in spare as also extra bolts, nut and bushings needed at the
moving joint of the handle.
iv.
Villagers should be taught to handle the pumps gently. The pump should
be set so that the cylinder is within 6.7-7.6 m of the lowest water table.
and can pump of a total head of 45-60 m.
2.
Jet Pumps :
i.
Jet pumps are often practicable for pumping rather small flows
(40-90 lpm) under low heads (15-45 m) when the water level is beyond
7.6 m from the ground surface. Their capacity reduces as the lift
increases.
ii.
Ajet pump consists of a pump and a jet.
iii.
Water is recirculated from the delivery side of the pump to the bottom of
the suction pipe and is injected through a nozzle to impart additional
kinetic energy.
iv.
This gives additional suction lift by creating a partial vacuum at this
point.
v.
The advantage of the jet pump over most other types of deep-well pumps
is that the pump and motor may be set away from the well.
vi.
Jet pumps are usually used for residential buildings and hotels.
vii. These are of two types : twin type for bore wells 15 em and above, and
packer type (duplex) for bore wells less than 15 em.
3.
Deep Well Vertical Turbine Pumps :
i.
Deep-well vertical turbine pumps are most widely used for large tube
wells.
ii.
The bowl-assembly (impellers) is kept below the lowest pumping water
level, but the driving unit-electric motor or petrol or diesel engine-is on
the ground surface and is connected by a long shaft.
iii.
Usually deep-well turbine pumps are used for tair(y high flows under
high heads. This type of pump has the advantages of high efficieney.
high head pumping capability and excellent serviceability.
Scanned with CamScanner
5-SC (CE-Sem-S)
Groundwater Quality and Modals
iv. The impellers can be obtained semi open or fully enclosed. This pump
requires sufficiently straight and plumb well for installation and proper
operation and is subject to abrasion from sand.
5.
The maintenance problem is severe when pumping corrosive water
unless pump. column. shaft etc., are made of non-corrosive materials.
Lubrication and vertical alignment of shaft is critical. The overall
efficiencies of turbine pumps range from 50 to so %.
4
Submersible Pumps:
i
Submersible pumps have the motor and the bowl assembly as a unit
submerged below the lowest pumping water level.
E
A water proof cable supplies power to motor.
E Submersible pumps to fit inside 10. 15, 20 and 25 cm borewells are
available in India.
in They can be used for low rates from 40-3000 lpm and heads from
15-150 =
T.
They can be installed in crooked wells but repair to motor or pump
requires removal from well is subject to abrasion from sand.
-2 This type of pump has the advantage that it can be installed when there
is little of DO floor space to install the unit and in locations that require
quiet operation.
EE
They can be either water or oil lubricated
the Their initial costs are lower than those of vertical turbine pumps. Their
repair and maintenance costs. however, are high.
in The new type of voltage regulated starters has solved the problem of
over loading
5. Air-Lift Pumps:
i
Air-lift pumps have efficiencies ranging from 20 to 35%; the efficiency
greethy depards upon the percentage submergence and is reasonable
when the percentage submergence is 50 to 60%.
il
They proups have the advantage of having no moving parts below the
gound level
il
However the disadvantage of low efficiency, coupled with the pump's
inability is puming againant high bead requirements, has limited its use.
in As lifts eat adapad is and wells, is wells discharging large amounts
of wad and is instaliationa where reliability is of more importance than
V.
Capacities for we pumping range from 90 to 9000 lpm.

Answer
Well Maimtemance :
1.
While the expected service life of a well depends upon the design.
construction, development and operation of the well. proper maintenance
helps to improve the performance and increase the life of the well.
2.
Proper records of power consumption. well discharge, drawdown,
operating hours, periodical chemical analysis of water and. other Fach
observations will help in devising proper maintenance procedures.
3.
The sudden pressure drop and increase in the entrance velocity near
the screen due to high pumping rates releases carbon dioxide and
causes precipitation of calcium carbonate and iron deposits near the
screen.
4.
The change in entrance velocities results in precipitation of iron and
manganese hydroxides.
5.
The presence of oxygen in the well can change soluble ferrous iron to
insoluble ferric hydroxide. The perforations can be cleaned by adding
hydrochloric (muriatic) acid or calgon followed by agitation and surging
which removes the incrusting deposits.
6.
Normally, the volume of acid required for a single treatment will be
about 1.5 to 2 times the volume of water in the screen.
7.
Sulfuric acid can also be used instead of hydrochloric acid but its
action is a little slower and requires a longer contact time in the well.
S.
The yield of the well may decrease due to the deposition of incrustation
of fine particles of silt and clay near the screen. This can be removed
by the use of a dispersing agent such as polyphosphates. For effective
treatment, 15 to 30 kg of polyphosphate is added to every 1000 litres of
water in the well.
9.
1 kg of calcium hypochlorite should be added for every 1000 litres of
water in the well to facilitate the removal of iron bacteria and their
slimes, and also for disinfection purposes.
10. The solution of polyphosphate and hypochlorite is poured into the well
and a surge plunger or the jetting technique is used to agitate the
water The well may be treated 2-3 times for better results
11. The perforations may become plugged with algae or bacterial growths
Chlorine treatmnent of wells has been found more effective than and
treatment in loosening bacterial growths and shme deposits which
often accompany the deposition of fron onde.

Write a short note on protection of water wells.
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 10
Answer
The protection of water wells can be consists of :
1 Sanitary Protection:
i
Wherever groundwater pumped from a well is intended for human
consumption. proper sanitary precautions must be taken to protect
the water quality Pollution sources may exist either above or belove
ground surface.
il
Surface pollution can enter wells either through the annular space
outside of the casing or through the top of the well itself.
il
To close avenues of access for undesirable water outside of the casing,
the annular space should be filled with cement grout for deep wells.
in. Entry through the top of the well can be avoided by providing a
watertight cover to seal the top of the casing.
T. Some pumpe are available with closed metal bases that provide the
necessary closure.
vi For pumps having an open-type base, or where the pump is not placed
directly over the well. a seal is required for the annular opening between
the discharge pipe and casing.
VEL Seals may be made of metal or lead packing, asphaltic and mastic
compounds are also satisfactory.
viii. Covers around the well should be made of concrete, should be elevated
above the adjacent land level, and should slope away from the well.
2
Frost Protection :
i
In regions where winter frost occurs, it is important to protect pumps
and water lines from freezing.
il
Provide pitless adopter for frostproofing a domestic well.
The pitless adapter, attached to the well casing, provides access to the
well, while the discharge pipe runs about 2 m underground basement
of the house.

AKTU 2015-16, Marks 10
Answer
A Contamination of Groundwater :
1
Groundwater is more protected than surface water, but it can be
contaminated from different sources.
2 Water dissolves more things than any other substance, it is very
susceptible to contamination or pollution.
3. Contamination is a modification of physical, chemical, and biological
properties of groundwater. restricting or preventing its use for various
purposes.
4.
It can impair the use of water and can create hazards to public health
through toxicity or the spread of disease.
5. Generally, contamination and pollution terms are used as synonymous
in groundwater.
6.
The possible pollutants in groundwater are many. They could be from
geogenic sources or anthropogenic sources.
7.
Contamination from the dissolution of aquifer material is geogenic.
Fluoride. arsenic. iron, and other heavy metals in groundwater are
usually due to geogenic source contamination.
8.
Anthropogenic sources and causes of groundwater pollution are
associated with human interventions and use of water.
9.
Most pollution stems from disposal of wastes on or into the ground.
10. The principal anthropogenic sources and causes (continuous and/or
accidental types) can be categorized as follows :
i
Municipal : Sewer leakage, liquid waste, solid waste, and landfill,
ii. Industrial : Liquid waste, leakage, mining activity, and oil field brine,
iii. Agricultural : Return flows, fertilizers and pesticides, and animal
waste,
iv. Miscellaneous : Salt water intrusion, acid rain, and de-icing salts.
B.
Remedial Measures : Measures that can be adopted to prevent,
reduce and eliminate the contamination are as follows
:

Describe fluoride removal techniques.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks os
Answer
Removal Techniques : Following are the technologies generally
used for removing fluorides from water :
1.
Absorption by activated alumina (AA), commonly known as Prashanti
technology.
2.
Nalgonda technique.
3.
Ion exchange adsorption method.
4.
Reverse osmosis process.
1.
Prashanti Technique using Adsorption by Activated Alumina
(AA) : In this methods, the raw water containing high contents of
fluoride, is passed (percolated) through the insoluble granular beds of
substance like activated alumina (AA), or Bone Char. or activated
carbon, or serpentinite, or activated bauxite : which adsorbs fluoride
from the percolating water, giving out defluoridated water.
2
Nalgonda Technique :
i.
Nalgonda technique uses aluminium salt (alum) for removing fluoride.
ii.
The raw water is firstly mixed with adequate amount of lime (CaO) or
sodium carbonate (Na,CO2) and thoroughly mixed.
iii.
Alum solution is then added, and water is stirred slowly for about 10
minutes, and allowed to settle for nearly one hour.
iv.
The precipitated sludge is discarded, and the clear supernatant containing
permissible amount of fluoride is withdrawn for use.
v.
The line diagram for the process is shown in Fig. 5.9.1.
vi. The added lime or sodium carbonate helps to ensure adequate alkalinity
required for effective hydrolysis of aluminium salts, so that the residual
aluminium does not remain in the treated water.
vii. Bleaching powder is also generally added with lime prior to the addition
of alum, to achieve simultaneous disinfection of treated water, and
also to keep the system free from undesirable biological growth.

What do you mean by saltwater intrasion im coastal
aquifer ? What is the method of locate it ? Explain the various
methods to limit saltwater intrasion
AKTU 2018-19. Marks 10
Answer
A Saltwater Intrusion =
1 Saltwater intrusion is the movement of saline water inco fresh water
aquifers. which can lead to contamination of drinking water sources
and other consequences.
2
Saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most coastal
aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection betwreen groundwater and
seawater.
3 Because saline water has a higher mineral content then fresi water. it
is denser and has a higher water pressure. As s result salwater can
push inland beneath the freshwater.
B. Method of Location of Intrusion in Coastal Aquifer: :
1.
Analysis of groundwater samples collected in zoges of seawater intrasion
may show a chemical composition differing from a simple proportional
mixing of seawater and groundwater.
2
Modifications in composition of seawater entering an aquifer ean accur
by three processes :
i
Base exchange between the water and the minerals of the aquifer
il
Sulfate reduction and substitution of carbonic or other weak acid redicals,
iti
Solution and precipitation
3.
Revelle recommended the chloride bicarbonate ratio as a criterion to
evaluate intrusion.
Scanned with CamScanner
5-16C (CE-Sem-8)
Groundwater Quality and Modals
4.
Chloride is the dominant anion of ocean water, is unaffected by the
above processes. and normally occurs in only small amounts in
groundwater.
5.
On the other hand. bicarbonate is usually the most abundant anion in
groundwater and occurs in only minor amounts in seawater.
6.
Although pollutants other than seawater can change the chloride-
bicarbonate ratio. these would seldom be important in water collected
from a well subject to intrusion.
C. Method : Foliowing are the methods of limit saltwater intrusion :
1.
Modification of Pumping Pattern :
i
Changing: the location of pumping wells. typically by dispersing them in
inland areas. can aid in reestablishing a stronger seaward hydraulic
gradment.
il Also reduction in pumping of existing wells can produce the same
beneficial effect.
2
Artificial Recharge:
i.
Groundwater levels can be raised and maintained by artificial recharge,
using surface spreading for unconfined aquifers and recharge wells for
confined aquifers.
il
This necessitates development of a supplemental water source.

2
Analog models
S
Model-based analytical formulas coupled with experience.
4.
Numerical models
The groundwater models may also be classified as continuous models
or discrete models Physical models and many analogs are continuous
models. whereas electric network-based analog models and majority
numerical models are discrete models.
1
Physical Models :
i
A physical model is a scaled-down model of a prototype aquifer.
E
In the case of physical models, scale factor need to be chosen, which
results 20 convenient model characteristics. These are conversion
constants that relate the corresponding parameters and variables of
the models to those of the aquifer.
in
Among the physical models, a sand tank model is most commonly
used for simulation of simple aquifer system.
iv. The sand tank model is a scale model of an aquifer with the boundaries
scaled down and the absolute value and spatial distribution of the
bydraulic conductivity modified.
v.
These models are constructed in water-tight columnar or wedge-shaped
boxes made of wood, perspex, or steel.
vi A uniform bydraulic conductivity in the model can be achieved by
placing coarse sand in small quantities under water and compacting
consistently to remove air.
VII Amsotropy can be attained by layers of different sands.
viil Complex boundaries, three-dimensional systems, free surfaces such
as water table and interfaces different liquids are also possible in eand
tank modele.
2
Analog Models :
i.
Analogs are devices with similar input-output or cause-and-effect
relations as the prototype, but with different physical properties.

à
Flow through porous medium obeys laws that are analogoum to laws
governing other physical systems. For example, viscous fluid flow.
membrane deflection. heat now. or flow of electrie current are some
of the physical phenomenon that are analogous to and governed by
similar mathemntical formulae as groundwater flow in porous media.
iii. These analogies provide a variety of techniques for studying the
movement of groundwater and models based on such analogy are
termed as analog models.
iv.
One of the greatest. advantages of the analog models is that time need
not be discretized otherwise the necessity of using time increments in
numerical modeling is always somewhat of an aggravation and source
of possible error.
3.
Model-Based Analytical Formulas Coupled with Experience :
i.
Analytical models generally require the solution of partial differential
equation. Such models may be deterministic, stochastic. or it may be a
combination of both.
ii.
Deterministic models are used for solving regional groundwater problems
involving cause and effect relationship of known systems and processes.
iii.
Stochastic models which are based on probabilities of occurrence can
be used in planning and decision-making processes for the groundwater
resources and in evaluating the uncertainties of a system.
iv. Model-based analytical formulas coupled with experience are always
one of the first to be applied in solving a groundwater problem.
v.
These models can greatly reduce the time and effort in assembling a
solution to a groundwater problem.
4.
Numerical Models :
i.
Mathematical formulations, which consist of appropriate differential
equations for the system, and their solutions, can be used as models
for duplicating the hydrology and evaluating the response of groundwater
reservoirs.
ii.
Analytical models that consist of various analytical solutions of the
differential equation of groundwater flow are applicable to relatively
uniform aquifers with simple geometry for problems involving parts
of aquifer of small areal extent, and have restricted use for problems
of heterogeneous and extensive aquifers with irregular boundaries
and multiple sources of recharge and discharge.

What do you understand by ground water exploration
and define surface evidence ?
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 10
A Groundwater Exploration =
1.
The procedure for predicting the availability of groundwater is known
as groundwater prospecting or groundwater investigation or
groundwater exploration or groundwater targeting.
2.
The objective of groundwater exploration is to locate aquifers capable
of yielding water of suitable quality, in economic quantities for various
purposes by using different techniques.
3.
The techniques used to access occurrence and quality of groundwater
can be classified as :
i
Surface investigation.
il
Sub-surface investigation
4.
Surface investigation methods include geologic, remote-sensing. and
geophysical methods (such as electrical resistivity. seismic, magnetic.
etc.), whereas subsurface investigation consist of well drilling and
logging methods.
B. Surface Evidence : Surface features identified on aerial photographs
that aid in evaluating groundwater conditions :
1.
Phreatophytes and aquatic plants.
2
Geologic land forms likely to contain relatively permeable strata :
il
Modern alluvial terraces and floodplains.
il
Stratified valley-fill deposits in abandoned meltwater and spillway
channels.
Glacial outwash and glacial deltas.

Localized gain or loss of streamflow.
iii. Nearby small perennial and intermittent lakes (e.g., lakes in outwash,
elongate saline lakes in nactive drainage systems).
iv. Perennial rivers and larg r creeks in valleys having inactive floodplains.

Small intermittent drainages (including misfit creeks in abandoned
glacial spillways and meltwater channels).
vi. No defined drainage channel in former glacial spillways and meltwater
channels.

il
String of alkali flats or lakes (playas, salinas) along inactive drainage
systems.
5. Springs :

Depression springs (where land surface locally cuts the water table
or
the upper surface of the zone of saturation).
ii.
Contact springs (permeable water-bearing strata overlying relatively
impermeable strata).
Que 5.15.
What are the surface geophysical techniques and explain
any one of them.
AKTU 2014-15, Marks 10
Answer
Following are the various surface geophysical techniques :
1.
Geophysical Exploration :
i.
Geophysical exploration is the scientific measurement of physical
properties of the earth's crust (subsurface formations and contained
fluids) by instruments located on the surface for investigation of
groundwater.
ii.
Now a day, the application of geophysical exploration to groundwater
is becoming common.
iii.
The success of these methods depends on how best the physical
parameters deduced are interpreted in term of aquifer parameters.
iv.
As the geophysical characteristic or its range is not unique, the choice
from more alternatives is based on experience on hydrogeology of the
area.
v.
Thus, these methods are frequently inexact and are most useful when
supplemented by other methods.
vi.
Geophysical methods detect difference or anomalies of physical properties
such as density, magnetism, elasticity, and electric resistivity within
the earth crust.

2.
Electric Resistivity Method :
i.
Surface electrical resistivity surveying is based on the principle that
the distribution of electrical potential in the ground around a current-
carrying electrode depends on the electrical resistivities and distribution
of the surrounding soils and rocks.
ii.
Electrical methods can be applied to describe the geologie setting and
patterns of groundwater existence and its quality.
iii.
In these methods, generally electrical conductivity (the ability of a
material to conduct electricity) or electrical resistivity (the reciprocal
of electrical conductivity) is measured.
iv.
The common rock-forming minerals have very high resistivity. Rocka
and sediments conduct electricity as a consequence of ions in solution
in the pore fluid and the charged layer present on clay minerals.
v.
Electric resistivity of rock of formation limits the amount of current
passing through the formation when an electric potential is applied.
vi.
The conductance of electricity is controlled by the content of Total
Dissolved Solids (TDS) in groundwater and the relative abundance of
clay minerals.
vii. The higher the TDS in the pore fluid in a formation, the lesser the
electric resistivity.
viii. Similarly, the higher the clay content in the formation with the same
pore water chemistry, the lesser the electric resistivity as the clay
offers very low resistivity.
ix.
Resistivity is higher in igneous rocks than in metamorphic rocks, and
it is less in sedimentary rocks.
x.
The metamorphic rocks contain hydrous minerals and fabric, whereas
the sedimentary rocks contain abundant pore space and fluids.
xi.
In, general, the resistivity of rock formation depends on materials,
density, porosity (pore size and shape), water content and quality, and
temperature. Joints and fractures present in hard rocks, when saturated,
results in low resistivity than the adjoining massive rock.
3.
Seismic Methods :
i.
Seismic methods utilize both reflected and refracted energy waves to
measure how fast and what paths these waves travel through different
types of lithologic units.
ii.
The seismic refraction method involves the creation of a small shock
at a depth of about 1 m or so (known as shot/shock point) either by the
impact of a heavy instrument or by a small explosive charge.
iii.
The arrival of the shock waves at various distances is measured with
sound detectors called geophones placed on the ground surface.
iv.
The change in the velocity of seismic waves is governed by changes in
the clastic properties of the formation.

V.
The travel time of seismic wave depends on the media through which
it passes.
vi. The velocity seismic/sound wave in subsurface material increases with
bulk density and water content.
vil. Porosity tends to decrease wave velocity, but water content increases
it
viii. In coarse alluvial materials, seismic velocity increases markedly from
unsaturated to saturated zones. The velocities are greatest in solid
igneous rocks (about 5,000 m/s) and least in loose unconsolidated
unsturated materials (about 250 m/s).
Que 5.16.
The resistivity of sample of formation water reduced to
a standard temperature of 27 °C is 15.2 ohm-m. If the formation
resistivity read from the electric log is 131 ohm-m, determine the
effective porosity of the formation. Assume cementation factor of 2
in the Archie's formula.

Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
5-25 C (CE-Sem-8)
Answer
A.
Recharge :
i.
Addition of surface water to zone of saturation is known as recharge.
ii.
Recharge taking place naturally as a part of hydrologic cycle is called
natural recharge while the process of increasing infiltration of surface
water to groundwater systems by altering natural conditions is known
as artificial recharge.
B.
Types : Following are the two types of recharge :
1.
Natural Recharge :
i.
The amount of precipitation that infiltrates into the soil and reaches
the zone of saturation is an important component of natural recharge.
ii.
Seepage from irrigated lands is another important component of recharge
of groundwater.
iii.
In this process, the infiltration phase is natural while the supply of
water to the irrigated lands is through artificial means and as such it
is sometimes called incidental recharge.
iv.
Other means of natural recharge are seepage from reservoirs; rivers,
streams and canals, and other water bodies.
2
Artificial Recharge :
i.
The process of artificially enhancing the amount of water recharging
the aquifer in a given location is known as artificial recharge.
ii.
In the face of present-day large demands for groundwater, artificial
recharge is resorted to :
a.
Conserve runoff.

Recharge Well Method :
i.
A recharge well may be defined as a well that admits water from the
surface to freshwater aquifers.
ii.
Its flow is the reverse of a pumping well, but its construction may or may
not be the same.
iii.
Well recharging is practical where deep, confined aquifers must be
recharged. or where economy of space, such as in urban areas, is an
important consideration.
iv.
If water is admitted into a well, a cone of recharge will be formed that is
similar in shape but is the reverse of a cone of depression surrounding
a pumping well.
v.
The equation for the curve can be derived in a similar manner to that for
a pumping well.

What is Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) and how it works ?
AKTU 2014-15, Marks-10
Scanned with CamScanner
Engg Hydrology & Ground Water Mgmt.
5-27 C (CE-Sem-8)
Answer
A.
Soil Aquifer Treatment :
1.
Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) is an artificial ground water aquifer
recharge.
2.
Water is introduced into the groundwater through soil percolation
under controlled conditions.
3.
Soil aquifer treatment is either used to artificially augment the
groundwater in order to withdraw freshwater again at alter stage or
as a barrier to prevent saltwater or contaminants from entering the
aquifer.
4.
During percolation, natural soil filtration occurs and the water enters
the aquifer where mixing and possibly some other physical and chemical
reactions may occur.
5.
This method can be used with reclaimed water (treated blackwater)
or relatively little polluted water.
B.
Working of SAT :
1.
SAT is the method used to recharge groundwater aquifers from the
surface or from below the surface.
2.
Typically, SAT is used to enter either storm water or pre-treated
wastewater through a recharge basin or an injection well.
3.
As the effluent moves through the soil and the aquifer, it can undergo
significant quality improvements through physical, chemical and biological
processes.
4.
The water is stored in the underlying unconfined aquifer generally
for subsequent reuse, such as irrigation or even for drinking water
purposes (generally after a water purification step).
5.
In short, SAT has benefits both in treatment in the dominant unsaturated
zone, which acts like a natural filter and storage within the saturated
zone depending on the wastewater quality, land availability and various
pre-treatment technologies such as horizontal, vertical and free-surface
constructed wet lands, waste stabilization ponds, UASB reactor or
advanced treatments such as activated sludge process, membrane
filtration etc.

Answer

Artificial Recharge : Refer Q. 5.17, Page 5-24C, Unit-5.
B.
Artificial Discharge :
1.
Discharge represents the upward outflow of groundwater from the
subsurface that occurs naturally or as the result of human activity,
notably well pumping. Well pumping is artificial discharge of
groundwater.
Scanned with CamScanner
5-2SC(CE-Sem-S)
Groundwater Quality and
2
During water pumping. water is removed from the aquifer surrounding
the well and the piezometric surface decreases.
3.
The groundwater within the influence of the pump flows toward the
well from every direction. instead of moving toward the natural discharge
area.
4
Drawdown is defined as the distance by which the piezometric surface
15 lowered Thus. one of the goals of groundwater resource study is to
predict hvdraulic-head drawdowns in aquifers under proposed pumping
schemes.
5
The pumping well creates an artificial discharge area by drawing down
(lowering) the water table around the well. The cone of depression is
attributed to a conical-shaped depression of the water table around a
pumping well caused by the withdrawal of water, a valley in the water
table.

leaching, gypsum addition.
4.
Very high sodium water (S4)

SAR : above 26.
C.
Catchment Approach to the Computation of Recharge =
1.
This method estimates the balance between the inflow and ousflow of
water. Here, the volume of water required to saturate the soil is expressed
as an equivalent depth of water and is called soil water deficit.
2.
The soil water balance can be represented by,
Ri = P - Ea +AW-Ro
where,
R1 = Recharge.
P = Precipitation.
Ea = Actual evapotranspiration,
AW = Change in soil water storage.
Rd = Runoff.
3.
When applying this method to estimate the recharge for a catchment
area, the calculation is to be repeated for areas with different

in PVC pipes and directed to a sump, or an existing old well. or a baby
well, about 0.6 m in a diameter and 5 m deep.
2
In Rural Areas :
i.
Community wells are constructed at a few places in a village. Within 3 to
6 m from this well, a bore well with a hand-operated pump is constructed
The area around the well and the bore well must be kept clean : No
washing (human, cattle, clothes and vehicles).
ii.
If there are existing water tanks in the village, they should be desilted
and dredged every three years.

In urban areas, the roof tops are usually impervious and occupy
considerable land area. Also, generally the municipal water supply in
likely to be inadequate. inefficient or unsuitable. In such situation,
collection of runoff from roof tops of individual structures and storing
than for later use has been found to be very attractive and economical
proposition in many cases.
3
In adequary of water availability and cost of supply has made many
industries and large institutions in urban areas situations in arid and
semi-arid regions to adopt RTWH systems in a big way.
4
Factors like water quality, methods for efficient and economical collection
and storage are some factors that have to be worked out in designing an
efficient system to meet specific needs.
5.
The cost of adequate size storage is, generally, a constraint in economical
RTWH design.

In many cases. water collected from roof top is used for recharging the
water characteristics of the rainfall at the place, such as intensity,
nature of the rainfall season, average number of rainy days,
the design of the RTWH design.

Permanent wilting point is the moisture content of a soil at which
the moisture is no longer available in sufficient quantity to sustain
the plants. At this stage, even though the soil contains some
moisture, it will be so held by the soil grains that the roots of the
plants are not able to extract it in sufficient quantities to sustain the
plants and consequently the plants wilt.

Ans. Following are the assumptions of steady flow in aquifers
i. The aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic, and of infinite and a real
extent, so that its coefficient of transmissibility or permeability is
constant everywhere.
ii. The well has been sunk through the full depth of the aquifer and it
receives water from the entire thickness of the aquifer.

43 inch/yr, evaporation of 53 inch/yr, surface water inflow
of 1 inch/yr, surface outflow of 173 inch/yr and change in
lake volume of-2 inch/yr. Determine the net groundwater
flow.
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 02
Given: P = 43 inch/yr. E = 53 inch/yr, I = 1 inch/yr
o = 173 inch/yr, AS = - 2 inch/yr
To Find : Net groundwater flow, G.
Assume net ground water flow is inflow.
According to water budget equation,
Inflow - Outflow = Change in storage
P+1+G-E-0 - - = AS
43 + 1+G - 53 - 173 = - 2
G = 180 inch/year
