QUE 1.3.
EXPLAIN DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSPORTED SOIL.
ANSWER
TYPES OF TRANSPORTED SOILS : FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF
TRANSPORTED SOIL :
1.
WATER TRANSPORTED SOILS : FLOWING WATER CARRIES A LARGE QUANTITY OF
SOIL EITHER IN SUSPENSION OR BY ROLLING ALONG THE BED.
ALL TYPE OF SOILS CARRIED AND DEPOSITED BY WATER ARE KNOWN AS ALLUVIAL
DEPOSITS. DEPOSITS MADE IN LAKES ARE CALLED LACUSTRINE DEPOSITS.
2
WIND TRANSPORTED SOILS : SOIL PARTICLES ARE TRANSPORTED BY WINDS.
SOILS DEPOSITED BY WIND ARE KNOWN AS AEOLIAN DEPOSITS. LOESS IS A SILT
DEPOSIT MADE BY WIND.
3.
GLACIER-DEPOSITED SOILS : AS THE GLACIERS MELT AND RECEDE, MATERIAL
CONTAINED IN THE ICE IS DEPOSITED ON THE GROUND LEADING TO FORMATION OF
GLACIAL DEPOSITS.
4
GRAVITY-DEPOSITED SOILS: SOILS CAN BE TRANSPORTED UNDER THE ACTION OF
GRAVITY. COLLUVIAL SOILS, SUCH AS TALUS, HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE GRAVITY.
QUE 1.4.
EXPLAIN THE MAJOR GROUPS OF SOIL DEPOSITS IN INDIA.
ANSWER
THE SOIL DEPOSITS IN INDIA MAY BE CLASSIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING FIVE MAJOR
GROUPS :
1.
ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS :
I.
A LARGE PART OF NORTH INDIA IS COVERED WITH ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS.
II.
THE THICKNESS OF ALLUVIUM IN THE INDO-GANGETIC AND BRAHMAPUTRA FLOOD
PLAINS VARIES FROM A FEW METRES TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED METRES.
2.
BLACK COTTON SOILS :
I
A
LARGE PART OF CENTRAL INDIA AND A PORTION OF SOUTH INDIA IS COVERED WITH
BLACK COTTON SOILS.
II.
THESE SOILS ARE RESIDUAL DEPOSITS FORMED FROM BASALT OR TRAP ROCKS. THE
SOILS ARE QUITE SUITABLE FOR GROWING COTTON.
3.
LATERITIC SOILS : LATERITIC SOILS ARE FORMED BY DECOMPOSITION OF ROCK,
REMOVAL OF BASES AND SILICA, AND ACCUMULATION OF IRON OXIDE AND ALUMINIUM
OXIDE. THE PRESENCE OF IRON OXIDE GIVES THESE SOILS THE CHARACTERISTICS RED
OR PINK COLOUR.
4.
DESERT SOILS : A LARGE PART OF RAJASTHAN AND ADJOINING STATES IS COVERED
WITH SAND DUNES. IN THIS AREA, ARID CONDITION EXISTS, WITH PRACTICALLY LITTLE
RAINFALL.
5.
MARINE DEPOSITS : MARINE DEPOSITS ARE MAINLY CONFINED ALONG A NARROW
BELT NEAR THE COAST. IN THE SOUTH-WEST COAST OF INDIA, THERE ARE THICK
LAYERS OF SAND ABOVE DEEP DEPOSITS OF SOFT MARINE CLAYS.

CHARACTERISTICS ARE DEPENDENT UPON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS OF CLIMATE,
RAW MATERIALS, PARENT MATERIAL, TOPOGRAPHY AND DRAINAGE, FLOW AND AGE.
QUE 1.6.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SOIL COMPOSITION ?
ANSWER
1.
SOIL IS A COMPLEX PHYSICAL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT PHASES.
2.
THE TERM PHASE MEANS ANY HOMOGENEOUS PART OF THE SYSTEM DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AND SEPARATED FROM THEM BY ABRUPT
TRANSITION.
3.
A MASS OF SOILS INCLUDES ACCUMULATED SOLID PARTICLES OR SOIL GRAINS AND THE
VOID SPACES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTICLES.
4.
THE VOID SPACES MAY BE PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER OR SOME
OTHER LIQUID, AND THOSE NOT OCCUPIED BY WATER OR ANY OTHER LIQUID ARE
FILLED WITH AIR OR SOME OTHER GAS.
5.
THE SOIL MASS GENERALLY CONSIST A THREE PHASE SYSTEM LIKE SOIL (SOLID),
WATER (LIQUID) AND AIR (GAS).


1-5A ()
6.
THE THREE CONSTITUENTS OF A SOIL MASS DO NOT OCCUPY SEPARATE SPACES BUT
ARE BLENDED TOGETHER FORMING A COMPLEX MATERIAL AS SHOWN IN
FIGURE. 1.6.L(A).
7.
WHEN THE SOIL VOIDS ARE COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER, THE GASEOUS PHASE
BEING ABSENT, THE SOIL IS SAID TO BE "FULLY SATURATED' OR 'MERELY SATURATED'.

WHEN THERE IS NO WATER AT ALL IN THE VOIDS, THE VOIDS WILL BE FULL OF AIR, THE
LIQUID PHASE BEING ABSENT, THE SOIL IS SAID TO BE DRY.
9.
IN BOTH THESE CASES, THE SOIL SYSTEM REDUCES TO A TWO-PHASE SYSTEM AS
SHOWN IN FIGURE. 1.6.1(C).

POROSITY (N) :
I.
IT IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE VOLUME OF VOIDS TO THE TOTAL VOLUME OF SOIL.
THUS
N = V. V .
II.
THE POROSITY OF A SOIL CANNOT EXCEED 100 % AS IT WOULD MEAN V. IS GREATER
U
THAN V. WHICH IS ABSURD. POROSITY IS ALSO KNOWN AS PERCENTAGE VOIDS.
3.
DEGREE OF SATURATION (S) :
I.
THE DEGREE OF SATURATION (S) IS THE RATIO OF THE VOLUME OF WATER TO THE
VOLUME OF VOIDS,
THUS
S = V.
II.
IT IS EQUAL TO ZERO WHEN THE SOIL IS ABSOLUTELY DRY AND 100 % WHEN THE SOIL
IS FULLY SATURATED.
4.
PERCENTAGE AIR VOIDS (N.) : IT IS THE RATIO OF THE VOLUME OF AIR TO THE
TOTAL VOLUME OF SOIL.
THUS
N.A = YO
5.
AIR CONTENT (A,) :
I.
IT IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE VOLUME OF AIR TO VOLUME OF VOIDS.
THUS
A.- =
II.
BOTH AIR CONTENT AND THE PERCENTAGE AIR VOIDS ARE ZERO WHEN THE SOIL IS
SATURATED (V. = 0).
6.
WATER CONTENT (W) : IT IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE MASS OF WATER TO
THE MASS OF SOLIDS.
W = M. M,
THE WATER CONTENT OF SOME OF THE FINE-GRAINED SOILS MAY BE EVEN MORE
THAN 100 %, WHICH INDICATES THAT MORE THAN 50 % OF THE TOTAL MASS IS THAT
OF WATER.
7.
BULK UNIT WEIGHT :
I.
THE BULK UNIT WEIGHT (Y) IS DEFINED AS THE TOTAL WEIGHT PER UNIT TOTAL
VOLUME. THUS
=
V/
W

SATURATED UNIT WEIGHT (YAME) : IT IS THE BULK UNIT WEIGHT WHEN THE SOIL
IS FULLY SATURATED.
THUS
=
10. SUBMERGED UNIT WEIGHT (R") : THE SUBMERGED UNIT WEIGHT OF THE SOIL
IS DEFINED AS THE SUBMERGED WEIGHT OF SOIL PER UNIT OF TOTAL VOLUME.
THUS
= W
V
11. SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF SOLIDS : THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF SOLID PARTICLES (G) IS
DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE MASS OF A GIVEN VOLUME OF SOLIDS TO THE MASS
OF AN EQUAL VOLUME OF WATER AT 4�C. THUS, THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS GIVEN BY,
G=P

THE BASIC STRUCTURAL UNITS OF KAOLINITE MINERAL ARE JOINED TOGETHER BY
HYDROGEN BOND. IT DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE OXYGEN ATOMS OF SILICA SHEET
AND THE HYDROXYLS OF GIBBSITE SHEET.
7.
SINCE THE HYDROGEN BOND IS FAIRLY STRONG, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO
SEPARATE THE LAYERS, AND HENCE, KAOLINITE MINERAL IS RELATIVELY STABLE.
8.
MOREOVER, WATER CANNOT PENETRATE THROUGH THE LAYERS OF THE STRUCTURAL
UNITS OF KAOLINITE MINERALS.
9.
KAOLINITE SHOWS RELATIVELY LITTLE SWELL ON WETTING.
10. CHINA CLAY IS ALMOST PURE KAOLINITE.
B. MONTMORILLONITE :
1.
MONTMORILLONITE IS THE MOST COMMON MINERAL OF THE MONTMORILLONITE
GROUP OF CLAY MINERALS.
2.
ITS BASIC STRUCTURAL UNIT CONSISTS OF GIBBSITE SHEET (G) SANDWICHED BETWEEN
TWO SILICA SHEETS (S).
3.
THE GIBBSITE SHEET MAY INCLUDE ATOMS OF ALUMINIUM, IRON OR MAGNESIUM,
OR A COMBINATION OF THESE.
4.
THE TOTAL THICKNESS OF BASIC STRUCTURAL UNIT OF MONTMORILLONITE IS ABOUT
10 A.
5.
THE BASIC STRUCTURAL UNITS OF MONTMORILLONITE MINERAL AREJOINED TOGETHER
BY A LINK BETWEEN OXYGEN IONS OF THE TWO SILICA SHEETS.
6.
THE LINK IS DUE TO NATURAL ATTRACTION FOR THE CATIONS IN THE INTERVENING
SPACE AND DUE TO VANDER WAAL FORCES.

IT IS POSSIBLE FOR FINE SANDS OR SILTS TO GET DEPOSITED SUCH THAT THE PARTICLES
WHEN SETTLING DEVELOP A PARTICLE-TO-PARTICLE CONTACT THAT BRIDGES OVER
LARGE VOIDS IN THE SOIL MASS [FIGURE. 1.22.1(B)]. THE PARTICLES WEDGE BETWEEN
ONE ANOTHER INTO A STABLE CONDITION AND FORM A SKELETON LIKE AN ARCH TO
CARRY THE WEIGHT OF THE OVERLYING MATERIAL. THE STRUCTURE SO FORMED IS
KNOWN AS HONEY-COMB STRUCTURE.
II.
THE HONEY-COMB STRUCTURE USUALLY DEVELOPS WHEN THE PARTICLE SIZE IS
BETWEEN 0.002 MM AND 0.02 MM.
III.
HONEY-COMB STRUCTURE OCCURS IN SOILS HAVING SMALL GRANULAR PARTICLES
WHICH HAVE COHESION BECAUSE OF THEIR FINENESS. SOILS IN HONEY-COMB
STRUCTURE ARE LOOSE.
3.
FLOCCULATED STRUCTURE :
I.
FLOCCULATED STRUCTURE OCCURS IN CLAYS. THE CLAY PARTICLES HAVE LARGE SURFACE
AREA AND, THEREFORE, THE ELECTRICAL FORCES ARE IMPORTANT IN SUCH SOILS.
II.
THE CLAY PARTICLES HAVE A NEGATIVE CHARGE ON THE SURFACE AND A POSITIVE
CHARGE ON THE EDGES.
III.
INTERPARTICLE CONTACT DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE POSITIVELY CHARGED EDGES AND
THE NEGATIVELY CHARGED FACES. THIS RESULTS IN A FLOCCULATED STRUCTURE AS

WET SIEVING IS CARRIED OUT FOR SEPARATING FINE GRAINS FROM COARSE GRAINS
BY WASHING THE SOIL SPECIMEN ON A 75 MICRON SIEVE MESH.
5.
DRY SIEVE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT ON PARTICLES COARSER THAN 75 MICRON.
SAMPLES (WITH FINES REMOVED) ARE DRIED AND SHAKEN THROUGH A SET OF
SIEVES OF DESCENDING SIZE. THE WEIGHT RETAINED IN EACH SIEVE IS MEASURED.
THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE QUANTITIES FINER THAN THE SIEVE SIZES (PASSING
EACH GIVEN SIEVE SIZE) ARE THEN DETERMINED.

OR
WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS IN THE USE OF STOKE'S LAW IN SEDIMENTNTION
ANALYSIS 7

ANSWER
A.
SEDIMENTATION ANALYSIS :
1. IT IS BEING CARRIED OUT FOR THE PARTICLES HAVING SIZE LESS THAN 0.075 MM
(FINE GRAIN PARTICLES).
2 PARTICLES HAVING SIZE LESS THAN 0.0002 MM CANNOT BE ANALYZED EVEN BY
SEDIMENTATION THESE PARTICLES CAN BE ANALYZED BY ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
OR BY X-RAY DIFFRACTION.
3.
THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON STOKE'S LAW. ACCORDING TO STOKE'S LAW, VELOCITY
OF PARTICLE DURING SETTLEMENT, THAT IS ASSUMED TO BE SPHERICAL, IS DEPENDENT
UPON SHAPE, SIZE AND MASS OF THE PARTICLE AND KEEPING ALL THE OTHER
FACTORS CONSTANT.

STOKE'S LAW IS APPLICABLE ONLY WHEN THE LIQUID IS INFINITE. THE PRESENCE OF
WALLS OF THE JAR AFFECTS THE RESULTS TO SOME EXTENT.
2
IN SCOKE'S LAW, IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED THAT ONLY ONE SPHERE SETTLES, AND
THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER SPHERES. IN THE SEDIMENTATION
ANALYSIS, AS MANY PARTICLES SETTLE SIMULTANEOUSLY, THERE IS SOME

3.
THE SEDIMENTATION ANALYSIS CANNOT BE USED FOR PARTICLES LARGER THAN
0.2 MM AS TURBULENT CONDITIONS DEVELOP AND STOKE'S LAW IS NOT APPLICABLE.
4.
THE SEDIMENTATION METHOD IS NOT APPLICABLE FOR PARTICLES SMALLER THAN
0.2 BECAUSE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT TAKES PLACE AND THE PARTICLES DO NOT

ANSWER
A.
HYDROMETER : A HYDROMETER IS AN INSTRUMENT USED FOR DETERMINING
THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LIQUIDS. AS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE SOIL SUSPENSION
DEPENDS UPON THE PARTICLE SIZE, A HYDROMETER CAN BE USED FOR THE PARTICLE
SIZE ANALYSIS.
B.
CORRECTIONS IN HYDROMETER ANALYSIS : FOLLOWING ARE THE CORRECTIONS
APPLIED IN OBSERVED HYDROMETER ANALYSIS :
1.
MENISCUS CORRECTION :
I.
THE HYDROMETER READING OF LOWER MENISCUS IS TO BE TAKEN. BUT SINCE THE
SOIL SUSPENSION IS OPAQUE THE READING OF UPPER MENISCUS IS TAKEN INSTEAD
OF LOWER MENISCUS. BECAUSE OF THIS AN ERROR IS INTRODUCED.
II.
A CORRECTION DUE TO MENISCUS CM) IS THEN APPLIED TO THE HYDROMETER
READING.
2.
TEMPERATURE CORRECTION :
I.
HYDROMETERS ARE CALIBRATED AT A TEMPERATURE OF 27�C.
II.
IN CASE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUSPENSION IS DIFFERENT FROM 27�C. A
CORRECTION DUE TO TEMPERATURE (+ CP IS TO BE APPLIED TO THE OBSERVED
HYDROMETER READINGS.
III.
IF THE TEST TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE THE STANDARD, THE CORRECTION IS ADDED
AND, IF BELOW. IT IS SUBTRACTED.
3.
DISPERSION AGENT CORRECTION :
I.
THE CORRECTION DUE TO RISE IN SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE SUSPENSION ON ACCOUNT
OF THE ADDITION OF THE DEFLOCCULATING/DISPERSING AGENT IS CALLED THE
DISPERSING AGENT CORRECTION (CA). CD IS ALWAYS NEGATIVE.

WRITE SHORT NOTE ON THIXOTROPY OF CLAY.
ANSWER
1.
WHEN NATURALLY FORMED CLAYS ARE REMOULDED, THEIR ORIGINAL CLAY STRUCTURE
IS DESTROYED AND THEY LOSE THEIR STRENGTH.
2
THE LOSS OF STRENGTH OF A SOIL DUE TO REMOULDING IS PARTLY DUE TO CHANGE IN
THE SOIL STRUCTURE AND PARTLY DUE TO DISTURBANCE CAUSED TO WATER MOLECULES
IN THE ABSORBED LAYER.
3.
SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE REVERSIBLE.
4.
IF A REMOULDED SOIL IS ALLOWED TO STAND, WITHOUT LOSS OF WATER, IT MAY
REGAIN SOME OF ITS LOST STRENGTH.

MEASURED VALUE OF LIQUID LIMIT OF THE SOIL BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN
THAT MEASURED USING THE STANDARD APPARATUS WHICH HAS A BASE MADE
OF HARD RUBBER ? DISCUSS THE RESULT.

ENGINEERING
ANSWER
THE LIQUID LIMIT IS LESS IN SPONGE AS COMPARE TO HARD RUBBER. FOLLOWA
REASONS NRE RESPONSIBLE FOR LESS LIQUID LIMIT
:
1 WHEN HARD RUBBER IS USED. IT CAN BEAR THE SHOCKS OF THE CUP DURING LA
IT WILL BEHAVE LIKE A HARD SURFACE. DUE TO THIS, THE SOIL DISPLACES FROM:
PLACE. THIS WILL SHOW THAT HOW MUCH LIQUID IS AVAILABLE IN THAT SAMPLE)
WILL SHOW HIGHER LIQUID LIMIT THAN SPONGY MATERIAL SURFACE AS SBORK
ENERGY 25 ABORBED BY SPONGE AND SOIL WILL NOT MOVE. HENCE, IT POSSESTE
LOW LIQUID LIMIT.
2
FROM CLASSIFICATION CURVE OF ATTERBERG. WE CAN SAY THAT IF THE WATE
CONTENT 15 LESS IN SOIL, IT WILL BEHAVE LIKE A PLASTIC MATERIAL AS IN CASED
SPONGY SURFACE IN WHICH THE SOIL DOES NOT MOVE, WILL BEHAVE AS PLASTIR E

1.
TOTAL STRESS :
I.
WHEN A LOAD IS APPLIED TO SOIL, IT IS CARRIED BY THE SOLID GRAINS AND THE
WATER IN THE PORES.
II.
THE TOTAL VERTICAL STRESS ACTING AT A POINT BELOW THE GROUND SURFACE IS DUE
TO THE WEIGHT OF EVERYTHING THAT LIES ABOVE, INCLUDING SOIL, WATER AND
SURFACE LOADING.
VERTICAL TOTAL STRESS AT HEIGHT H, A =
H
III.
TOTAL STRESS THUS INCREASES WITH HEIGHT AND WITH UNIT WEIGHT.

PORE WATER PRESSURE :
I.
PORE WATER PRESSURE (U) IS THE PRESSURE DUE TO PORE WATER FILLING THE
VOIDS OF THE SOIL. THUS
=
II.
PORE WATER PRESSURE IS ALSO KNOWN AS NEUTRAL PRESSURE OR NEUTRAL STRESS,
BECAUSE IT CANNOT RESIST SHEAR STRESSES.
3.
EFFECTIVE STRESS :
I.
THE EFFECTIVE STRESS (A ) AT A POINT IN THE SOIL MASS IS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL
STRESS MINUS THE PORE WATER PRESSURE. THUS,

WHERE,
T = COEFFICIENT OF PERMEABILITY.
I = HYDRAULIC GRADIENT.
AS = DIFFERENCE IN TOTAL HEADS.
L = LENGTH OF THE SOIL MASS.
VALIDITY OF DARCY'S LAW
:
1.
DARCY'S LAW IS VALID IF THE FLOW THROUGH SOILS IS LAMINAR.
2
IT IS VALID FOR FLOW IN CLAYS, SILTS AND FINE SANDS. IN COARSE SANDS, GRAVELS
AND BOULDERS, THE FLOW MAY BE TURBULENT AND DARCY'S LAW MAY NOT BE
APPLICABLE.
3.
FOR DARCY'S LAW TO THE VALID, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VELOCITY (V) AND
HYDRAULIC GRADIENT (I) SHOULD BE LINEAR.
4.
IN EXTREMELY FINE-GRAINED SOILS, SUCH AS COLLOIDAL CLAY, THE INTERSTICES ARE
VERY SMALL. THE VELOCITY IS THEREFORE VERY SMALL. IN SUCH SOILS, THE DARCY'S
LAW IS NOT VALID.

DISCUSS THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PERMEABILITY OF SOILS :
1.
PROPERTIES OF PORE FLUID:
I.
PORE FLUIDS ARE FLUIDS THAT OCCUPY PORE SPACES IN A SOIL OR ROCK.
N.
PERMEABILITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE UNIT WEIGHT OF PORE FLUID AND
INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO VISCOSITY OF PORE FLUID.
2
VOID RATIO : INCREASE IN THE VOID RATIO INCREASES THE AREA AVAILABLE FOR
FLOW BENCE PERMEABILITY INCREASES FOR CRITICAL CONDITIONS.
3.
ENTRAPPED AIR AND ORGANIC IMPURITIES : THE ORGANIC IMPURITIES AND
ENTRAPPED AIR OBETRUCT THE FLOW AND COEFFICIENT OF PERMEABILITY IS REDUCED
DUE TO THEIR PRESENCE.
4
ADVORBED WATER:
I
ADSORBED WATER MEANS A THIN MICROSCOPIC FILM OF WATER SURROUNDING
INDIVIDUAL NOIL GRAINS.
II.
THIS WATER IS NOT FREE TO MOVE AND HENCE REDUCES THE EFFECTIVE PORE
#PACE AND THUS DECREASES COEFFICIENT OF PERMEABILITY.

2-20 A ()
SOIL HYDRAULICS
5.
SHAPE OF PARTICLES : PERMEABILITY IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO SPECIFIC
SURFACE E.G-. AS ANGULAR SOIL HAVE MORE SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA COMPARED TO
THE ROUND SOIL THEREFORE, THE SOIL WITH ANGULAR PARTICLES IS LESS PERMEABLE
THAN SOIL OF ROUNDED PARTICLES.

GRADIENT.
OR
EXPLAIN HOW UPWARD FLOW OF SEEPAGE WATER CAUSES THE EFFECTIVE
STRESS. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PORE WATER PRESSURE IN THE QUICK SAND
CONDITION ?
10
ANSWER
1.
WHEN FLOW TAKES PLACE IN UPWARD DIRECTION, SEEPAGE PRESSURE ALSO ACTS
VERTICALLY UPWARD WHICH RESULTS IN DECREASE OF EFFECTIVE PRESSURE IN THE
SOIL.
2.
IF SEEPAGE PRESSURE IS SUCH THAT IT EQUALS THE SUBMERGED WEIGHT OF SOIL,
EFFECTIVE STRESS REDUCES TO ZERO.
3.
IN SUCH CONDITION SHEAR STRENGTH OF COHESIONLESS SOIL MASS IS ZERO AND
SOIL PARTICLES HAVE TENDENCY TO FLOW WITH WATER.

S CAPILLARY DEPENDS ON THE GRAIN SIZE AND THE SIZE OF PORE.
4.
IN COARSE GRAINED SOILS THE CAPILLARY RISE IS VERY SMALL COMPARE TO FITE
GRAINED SOULS.
B. UPLIFT PRESSURE:
1
UPLIF PRESSURE AT ANY GIVEN POINT IS THE PORE WATER PRESSURE ACTING
VERTICALLY UPWARD DUE TO THE RESIDUAL PRESSURE HEAD AT THAT POINT
2
THE DIAGRAM OF DISTRIBUTION OF UPLIFT PRESSURE ALONG THE BASE OF THE DAS
CAN BE DRAWN AND THE TOTAL UPLIFT FORCE THEN CALCULATED BY WORKING ON
THE AREA OF THE UPLIFT PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION DIAGRAM.

GETERALLY ADVERTED TO PREVENT PIPING FAILURES :
1. INCRVASING THE PATH OF PERCOLATION :

2-28 A ()
HYDRAULICA
I
THE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT (I) DEPENDS UPON THE PATH OF PERCOLATION (L). IF
THE LENGTH OF THE PATH IS INCREASED. THE EXIT GRADIENT WILL DECREASE TO A
SAFE VALUE.
H.
THE LENGTH OF THE PATH OF PERCOLATION CAN BE INCREASED BY ADOPTING THE
FOLLOWING METHODS:
A.
INCREASING THE BASE WIDTH OF THE HYDRAULIC STRUCTURE
B.
PROVIDING VERTICAL CUT OFF WALLA BELOW THE HYDRAULIC STRUCTURE
C.
PROVIDING AN UPETREAM IMPERVIOUS BLANKET, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.23.1.
2
REDUCING SEEPAGE:
I.
WITH A REDUCTION OF SEEPAGE THROUGH THE DAM. THE CHANCES OF PIPING
FAILURE THROUGH THE BODY OF THE DAM ARE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED.
II.
THE QUANTITY OF SEEPAGE DISCHARGE IS REDUCED BY PROVIDING AN IMPERVIOUS
CORE, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.23.1.
3
PROVIDING DRAINAGE FILTER
I.
A DRAINAGE FILTER CHANGES THE DIRECTION OF FLOW AWAY FROM THE DOWNSTREAM
FACE.
II.
IT PREVENTS THE MOVEMENT OF SOIL PARTICLES ALONG WITH WATER
III.
THE DRAINAGE FILTER MAY BE HORIZONTAL OR IN THE FORM OF A ROCK THE IT MAY
ALSO BE IN THE FORM OF A CHIMNEY DRAIN. AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.23.1.
IV.
A CHIMNEY DRAIN IS EFFECTIVE FOR STRATIFIED SOIL DEPOSITS IN WHICH THE
HORIZONTAL PERMEABILITY IS GREATER THAN THE VERTICAL PERMEABILITY.
4.
LOADED FILTER :
I.
A LOADED FILTER CONSISTS OF GRADED SAND AND GRAVELS. THE FUNCTION OF THE
LOADED FILTER IS TO INCREASE THE DOWNWARD FORCE WITHOUT INCREASING THE
UPWARD SCEPAGE FORCE.
II. THE LOADED FILTER IS PLACED AT THE EXIT POINT WHERE THE WATER EMERGES
FROM THE FOUNDATION

FIGURE. 2.24.1. CAPILLARY SIPHONING.
2.
THE WATER RISES IN THE OUTER SHELL DUE TO CAPILLARY ACTION. IF THE CREST (TOP
LEVEL) OF THE IMPERVIOUS CORE IS IN THE REACH OF CAPILLARY RISE, WATER FLOWS
FROM THE STORAGE RESERVOIR TO THE DOWNSTREAM OVER THE CORE.
3.
CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF STORED WATER MAY BE LOST TO CAPILLARY SIPHONING
4.
TO PREVENT THIS, THE CREST OF THE IMPERVIOUS CORE SHOULD BE KEPT
SUFFICIENTLY HIGH.
5.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE DIFFERENCE OF TOP LEVEL OF THE CORE AND WATER LEVEL IN
THE RESERVOIR SHOULD BE MORE THAN THE CAPILLARY RISE IN SOIL OF THE SHELL.
PARTIALLY SATURATED SOIL :
1.
GENERALLY THE SOIL IS MADE UP OF THREE PHASES, WHICH ARE CALLED AS SOIL
SOLID. WATER AND AIR.
2.
IF THE PORE OR VOID SPACE IN THE SOIL IS FULLY OCCUPIED BY THE WATER, THEN IT
IS FULLY SATURATED.
3.
IF THE VOIDS SPACE IN THE SOIL IS PARTIALLY OCCUPIED BY WATER, THE PORE IS SAID
TO BE PARTIALLY SATURATED.

SUCH A SITUATION CAN BE PREVENTED BY THE USE OF A FILTER OR PROTECTIVE
FILTER BETWEEN THE TWO SOILS.
4.
FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THE EARTH DAM SECTION SHOWN IN FIGURE. 2.25.1.
5.
IF ROCK FILLS WERE ONLY USED AT THE TOE OF THE DAM, THE SEEPAGE WATER
WOULD WASH THE FINE SOIL GRAINS INTO THE TOE AND UNDERMINE THE STRUCTURE.

QUE 3.1.
WHAT IS COMPACTION ? WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT OF THE
ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF A SOIL MASS CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH
COMPACTION ?
ANSWER
A.
COMPACTION : IT MEANS PRESSING THE SOIL PARTICLES CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BY
MECHANICAL METHODS. DURING COMPACTION, AIR IS EXPELLED FROM THE VOID
SPACE IN THE SOIL MASS.
B.
EFFECTS OF COMPACTION ON ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF SOIL :
FOLLOWING ARE THE ENGINEERING PROPERTIES AFFECTED BY THE COMPACTION OF
SOIL.
1.
PERMEABILITY : THE EFFECT OF COMPACTION IS TO DECREASE THE PERMEABILITY.
IN THE CASE OF FINE GRAINED SOILS IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT FOR THE SAME DRY
DENSITY SOIL COMPACTED WET OF OPTIMUM WILL BE LESS PERMEABLE THAN THAT
OF COMPACTED DRY OF OPTIMUM.
2
COMPRESSIBILITY : IN CASE OF SOIL SAMPLES INITIALLY SATURATED AND HAVING
SAME VOID RATIO, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT IN LOW PRESSURE RANGE A WET SIDE
COMPACTED SOIL IS MORE COMPRESSIBLE THAN A DRY SIDE COMPACTED SOIL. AND
VICE VERSA IN HIGH PRESSURE RANGE.
3.
PORE PRESSURE :
I.
IN UNDRAINED SHEAR TEST CONDUCTED ON SATURATED SAMPLES OF CLAY IT HAS
BEEN FOUND THAT LOWER PORE PRESSURES DEVELOP AT LOW STRAINS WHEN THE
SAMPLE IS COMPACTED DRY OF OPTIMUM, COMPARED TO THE CASE WHEN THE
SAMPLE IS COMPACTED WET OF OPTIMUM.
II.
BUT AT HIGH STRAINS IN BOTH TYPES OF SAMPLES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PORE
PRESSURE IS SAME FOR SAME DENSITY AND WATER CONTENT.
4.
STRESS-STRNIN RELATION : SAMPLES COMPACTED DRY OF OPTIMUM PRODUCE
MUCH STEEPER STRESS-STRAIN CURVES WITH PEAKS AT LOW STRAINS, WHEREAS
SAMPLES COMPACTED WET OF OPTIMUM, HAVING THE SAME DENSITY, PRODUCE
MUCH FLATTER STRESS-STRAIN CURVES WITH INCREASE IN STRESS EVEN AT HIGH
STRAINS.


3-3 A ()
5.
SHRINKAGE AND SWELLING :
I.
AT SAME DENSITY A SOIL COMPACTED DRY OF OPTIMUM SHRINKS APPRECIABLY
LESS THAN THAT OF COMPACTED WET OF OPTIMUM.
IL
ALSO THE SOIL COMPACTED DRY OF OPTIMUM EXHIBITS GREATER SWELLING
CHARACTERISTICS THAN SAMPLES OF THE SAME DENSITY COMPACTED WET OF
OPTIMUM.
QUE 3.2.
WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE COMPACTION ?
ANSWER
FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPACTION : FOLLOWING ARE FACTORS THAT AFFECT
THE COMPACTION :
1.
WATER CONTENT : AS THE WATER CONTENT IS INCREASED, THE COMPACTED
DENSITY GOES ON INCREASING: TILL A MAXIMUM DRY DENSITY IS ACHIEVED AFTER
WHICH FURTHER ADDITION OF WATER DECREASES THE DENSITY.
2
AMOUNT OF COMPACTION
:
I.
THE AMOUNT OF COMPACTION GREATLY AFFECTS THE MAXIMUM DRY DENSITY AND
OPTIMUM WATER CONTENT OF A GIVEN SOIL.
IL
THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE COMPACTIVE ENERGY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN
THE MAXIMUM DRY DENSITY AND DECREASE IN THE OPTIMUM WATER CONTENT.
3.
METHOD OF COMPACTION : THE DENSITY OBTAINED DURING COMPACTION, FOR
A GIVEN SOIL. GREATLY DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF COMPACTION OR THE MANNER
IN WHICH THE COMPACTIVE EFFORT IS APPLIED.
4.
TYPE OF SOIL : THE MAXIMUM DRY DENSITY ACHIEVED CORRESPONDING TO
A
GIVEN COMPACTIVE ENERGY LARGELY DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF SOIL.
5.
ADMIXTURE :
I
THE COMPACTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOILS ARE IMPROVED BY ADDING OT HER
MATERIALS KNOWN AS ADMIXTURES.
IL
THE MOST COMMONLY USED ADMIXTURES ARE LIME, CEMENT AND BITUMEN.

OR
WHAT ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF FIELD COMPACTING EQUIPMENTS ? WHICH
TYPES OF ROLLERS ARE SUITED FOR CLAYEY AND GRAVEL SOILS ? ALSO GIVE
SPECIFICATIONS OF SUCH ROLLERS.
ANSWER
METHOD OF COMPACTION : THE THREE METHODS OF COMPACTION USED IN
PRACTICE ARE RAMMING, ROLLING AND VIBRATIONS.
A.
RAMMING :
1.
IN THIS METHOD OF SOIL COMPACTION, TAMPERS ARE USED.
2
A HAND-OPERATED TAMPER (OR RAMMER) CONSISTS OF A BLOCK OF IRON (OR
STONE), ABOUT 3 TO 5 KG IN MASS, ATTACHED TO A WOODEN ROD. THE TAMPER IS
LIFTED FOR ABOUT 0.30 M AND DROPPED ON THE SOIL TO BE COMPACTED.
3.
A MECHANICAL RAMMER IS OPERATED BY COMPRESSED AIR OR GASOLINE POWER.

3-4 A ()
SOIL COMPACTION & CONSOLIDATION
IT IS MUCH HEAVIER, ABOUT 30 TO 150 KG. MECHANICAL RAMMERS HAVE BEEN
USED UPTO A MASS OF 1000 KG IN SOME SPECIAL CASES.
4.
TAMPERS ARE USED TO COMPACT SOILS ADJACENT TO EXISTING STRUCTURES OR
CONFINED AREAS, SUCH AS TRENCHES AND BEHIND THE BRIDGE ABUTMENTS,
WHERE OTHER METHODS OF COMPACTION CANNOT BE USED.
5.
OWING TO VERY LOW OUTPUT, TAMPERS ARE NOT ECONOMICAL WHERE LARGE
QUANTITIES OF SOILS ARE INVOLVED. TAMPERS CAN BE USED FOR ALL TYPES OF SOILS.
B. ROLLING : ROLLING OF SOIL IS DONE BY VARIOUS TYPES OF ROLLERS.
1.
SMOOTH WHEEL ROLLER :
I.
A SMOOTH-WHEEL ROLLER GENERALLY CONSISTS OF THREE WHEELS; TWO LARGE
WHEELS IN THE REAR AND ONE SMALL WHEEL IN THE FRONT.
II.
A TANDEM TYPE SMOOTH-WHEEL ROLLER CONSISTS OF ONLY TWO DRUMS; ONE IN
REAR AND ONE IN THE FRONT.
III. THE MASS OF A SMOOTH-WHEEL ROLLER GENERALLY VARIES BETWEEN 2 TO 15 MG.
IV.
IN THESE TYPES OF ROLLERS COMPACTION IS ACHIEVED BY THE APPLICATION OF
PRESSURE OVER THE SOIL MASS.
V.
THESE ARE GENERALLY SUITABLE FOR CRUSHED STONES, GRAVEL AND SAND
(COARSE GRAINED SOIL).
VI. THIS IS GENERALLY USED FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION
2
SHEEP FOOT ROLLER :
I.
THIS TYPE OF ROLLER HAS MANY ROUND AND RECTANGULAR SHAPED PROJECTIONS
OR FEET ATTACHED TO A STEEL DRUM.
II.
ONE FOOT HAS 50 TO 100 CM� SURFACE AREA AND 150 TO 250 MM FEET PROJECTION
FROM THE DRUM SURFACE.
III.
AS THE COVERAGE IS ABOUT 8 TO 12%, VERY HIGH CONTACT PRESSURE, RANGING
FROM 1400 TO 7000 KPA, DEPENDING UPON THE SIZE OF DRUM AND WHETHER
THE DRUM IS PARTLY OR FULLY FILLED BY WATER OR SAND.
IV. THIS TYPE OF ROLLER COMPACTION IS ACHIEVED BY KNEADING ACTION WHICH
PROVIDES COMPARATIVELY STRONGER BOND BETWEEN COMPACTING LAYERS OF THE
SOIL MASS.
V.
THESE ARE GENERALLY USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CORE OF EARTHEN DAM
(COHESIVE SOILS SUCH AS CLAY AND SILT).
3.
PNEUMATIC TYRED ROLLER :
I.
THIS TYPE OF ROLLER CONSISTS OF A BOX OR PLATFORM MOUNTED BETWEEN TWO
AXLES. THE REAR AXLE HAS ONE WHEEL MORE THAN AT THE FRONT.
N.
THIS ROLLER HAS ABOUT 80 % COVERAGE, I.E., 80 � % OF THE TOTAL AREA IS COVERED
BY TYRES.
III.
THE TYRE PRESSURE IN SMALL ROLLERS IS OF THE ORDER OF 250 KPA WHERE AS IN
HEAVIER ROLLERS, IT MAY RANGE BETWEEN 400 AND 1050 KPA.
IV.
THE SOILS ARE USUALLY COMPACTED IN ABOUT 200 MM THICK LAYERS WITH 8 TO
10 PASSES OF THE ROLLERS.
V.
IN THESE ROLLERS, COMPACTION IS ACHIEVED BY USE OF BOTH PRESSURE AND
KNEADING ACTION.
VI.
THESE ARE SUITABLE FOR ALL TYPES OF SOIL BUT ARE GENERALLY USED FOR COHESIVE
SOILS.
VII. THESE ARE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AIR FIELDS, ROADWAYS AND EARTHEN
DAMS.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMPRESSIBILITY OF SOIL ?
ANSWER
1.
THE PROPERTY OF THE SOIL DUE TO WHICH DECREASE IN VOLUME OCCURS UNDER
COMPRESSIVE FORCES IS KNOWN AS THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF SOIL.
2.
WHEN THE SOIL MASS IS SUBJECTED TO A COMPRESSIVE FORCE, LIKE ALL OTHER
MATERIALS, ITS VOLUME DECREASES.
3.
THE COMPRESSION OF SOILS CAN OCCUR DUE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING
REASONS :
I.
COMPRESSION OF SOLID PARTICLES AND WATER IN THE VOIDS.
II.
COMPRESSION AND EXPULSION OF AIR IN THE VOIDS.
III.
EXPULSION OF WATER IN VOIDS.
4.
COMPRESSION OF SOIL ALSO TAKES PLACE BY EXPULSION OF AIR FROM THE VOIDS
UNDER A VIBRATORY LOAD; SUCH N COMPRESSION IS USUALLY KNOWN AS
COMPACTION.
5.
IN N SATURATED SOIL MASS HAVING ITS VOIDS FILLED WITH INCOMPRESSIBLE WATER,
DECREASE IN VOLUME OR COMPRESSION CAN TAKES PLACE WHEN WATER IS
EXPELLED OUT OF THE VOIDS. SUCH A COMPRESSION RESULTING FROM A LONG TERM
STATIC LOAD AND THE CONSEQUENT ESCAPE OF PORE WATER IS TERMED AS A
CONSOLIDATION

C. SECONDARY CONSOLIDATION.
ANSWER
A.
IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT:
L
IMMEDIATE OR ELASTIC SETTLEMENT TAKES PLACE DURING OR IMMEDIATET AFTER
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STRUCTURE.
2
IT IS ALSO KNOWN 25 THE DISTORTION SETTLEMENT AS IT IS DUE TO DISTERTIONS
(AND NOT THE VOLUME CHANGE) WITHIN THE FOUNDATION SOIL
3. ALTHOUGH THE SETTLEMENT IS NOT TRULY ELASTIC, IT IS COMPUTED USING ELASTIC
THEORY. ESPECIALLY FOR COHESIVE SOILS.
B. PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION :
1.
AFTER INITIAL CONSOLIDATION, FURTHER REDUCTION IN VOLUME OCCURS DUE TO THE
EXPULSION OF WATER FROM THE VOIDS.
2
WHEN SATURATED SOIL IS SUBJECTED TO A PRESSURE, INITIALLY ALL THE PRESSURE
IS TAKEN UP BY THE WATER AS AN EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE.
3.
AS WATER IS ALMOST INCOMPRESSIBLE AS COMPARED WITH SOLID PARTICLES. A
HYDRAULIC GRADIENT DEVELOPS AND WATER STARTS FLOWING OUT AND DECREASE
IN VOLUME OCCURS.
4.
THE DECREASE DEPENDS UPON THE PERMEABILITY OF SOIL AND IS THEREFORE,
TIME DEPENDENT
5.
THIS REDUCTION IN VOLUME IS CALLED PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION.
C.
SECONDARY CONSOLIDATION :
1.
THE REDUCTION IN VOLUME CONTINUES AT A VERY ALOW RATE EVEN AFTER THE
EZCESS HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE DEVELOPED BY THE APPLIED PRESSURE IS FULLY
DISSIPATED AND THE PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION I. COMPLETE.
2
THE ADDITIONAL REDUCTION IN VOLUME IS CALLED SECONDARY CONSOLIDATION
3.
IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PLASTIC READJUSTMENT OF THE SOLID PARTICLES AND THE
ADSORBED WATER TO NEW STRESS SYSTEM.

A. ASSUMPTIONS : FOLLOWING ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN TERZAGHI'S ONE
DIMENSIONAL CONSOLIDATION THEORY :
1.
THE SOIL MASS IS HOMOGENEOUS AND FULLY SATURATED
2.
THE SOIL PARTICLES AND WATER ARE INCOMPRESSIBLE.
3.
DARCY'S LAW FOR FLOW OF WATER THROUGH SOIL MASS IS APPLICABLE DURING
CONSOLIDATION


3-13 A ()
4.
COEFFICIENT OF PERMEABILITY IS CONSTANT DURING CONSOLIDATION.
5.
LOAD IS APPLIED IN ONE DIRECTION ONLY AND DEFORMATION OCCURS ONLY IN THE
DIRECTION OF LOAD APPLIED.
6.
THE DEFORMATION IS ENTIRELY DUE TO DECREASE IN VOLUME.
7.
THE DRAINAGE OF PORE WATER OCCURS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION.
S.
A BOUNDARY DRAINAGE FACE OFFERS NO RESISTANCE TO FLOW OF WATER FROM SOIL.
9.
DURING CONSOLIDATION THE CHANGE IN THICKNESS IS CONTINUOUS BUT FINAL
VALUE OF COMPRESSION IS RELATED TO INITIAL THICKNESS ONLY.
B. DERIVATION :
1.
FIGURE. 3.12.1, SHOWS A CLAY LAYER OF THICKNESS H, SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO
LAYERS OF SAND WHICH SERVES AS DRAINAGE FACES.

STRESS INCREMENT AT POINTS DIRECTLY BENEATH THE LOAD UPTO A DEPTH OF
10 M AND DRAW A PLOT FOR THE VERTICAL STRESS VARIATION UPTO DEPTH OF

10
ANSWER
A.
REASON FOR APPROPRIATE SOLUTION :
1.
BOUSSINESQ'S SOLUTION ASSUMES THAT THE DEPOSIT IS ISOTROPIC. ACTUAL
SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS ARE GENERALLY ANISOTROIPIC.
2.
THERE ARE GENERALLY THIN LAYERS OF SAND EMBEDDED IN HOMOGENEOUS
CLAY STRATA.
3.
WESTERGAARD'S SOLUTION ASSUMES THAT THERE ARE THIN SHEETS OF RIGID
MATERIALS SANDWICHED IN A HOMOGENEOUS SOIL MASS.
4.
THESE THIN SHEETS ARE CLOSELY SPACED AND ARE OF INFINITE RIGIDITY AND ARE,
THEREFORE, INCOMPRESSIBLE.
5.
THESE PERMIT ONLY DOWNWARD DISPLACEMENT OF THE SOIL MASS AS A WHOLE
WITHOUT ANY LATERAL DISPLACEMENT.
6.
THEREFORE, WESTERGAARD'S SOLUTION REPRESENTS MORE CLOSELY THE ACTUAL
SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS.

SIGNIFICANCE IS THE ONE WHICH ENCLOSES A SOIL MASS WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE

WHAT IS MOHR'S CIRCLE ? DISCUSS ITS IMPORTANT
CHARACTERISTICS.
02
ANSWER
MOHR'S CIRCLE :
1.
MOHR'S CIRCLE IS A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF A GENERAL STATE OF STRESS AT
A POINT.
2
IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE LOCUS OF STRESS COORDINATES (C. =) FOR ALL PLANES
THROUGH A POINT IS A CIRCLE, THE MOHR CIRCLE OF STRESS.
3.
TO DRAW A MOHR CIRCLE, THE NORMAL STRESS OIS PLOTTED ALONG THE X-AXIS AND
SHEAR IS PLOTTED ALONG THE Y-AXIS.
4.
THIS METHOD IS USED FOR EVALUATION OF PRINCIPAL STRESSES, MAXIMUM SHEAR
STRESS, NORMAL AND TANGENTIAL STRESSES ON ANY GIVEN PLANE.
CHARACTERISTICS : FOLLOWING ARE THE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF MOHR'S
CIRCLE:
1.
THE MAXIMUM SHEAR STRESS I
IS NUMERICALLY EQUAL TO (G1 AND IT
OCCURS ON A PLANE INCLINED AT 45� TO THE PRINCIPAL PLANES AS SHOWN IN FIGURE.

QUE 4.14.
DESCRIBE THE MOHR-COULOMB FAILURE THEORY.
ANSWER
1.
ACCORDING TO MOHR, THE FAILURE IS CAUSED BY A CRITICAL COMBINATION OF THE
NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESSES.
2.
WHEN THE SOIL SAMPLE HAS FAILED, THE SHEAR STRESS ON THE FAILURE PLANE
DEFINES THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE SOIL. THUS IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE
FAILURE PLANE.


4-19 A ()
3.
FAILURE OF THE MATERIAL OCCURS WHEN THE MOHR CIRCLE OF THE STRESSES
TOUCHES THE MOHR ENVELOPE.
4.
AT THE POINT OF CONTACT (D) OF THE FAILURE ENVELOPE ON THE MOHR CIRCLE, THE
CRITICAL COMBINATION OF SHEAR AND NORMAL STRESSES IS REACHED AND THE
FAILURE OCCURS. THE PLANE INDICATED BY THE LINE PD IS, THEREFORE, THE
FAILURE PLANE.
5.
ANY MOHR'S CIRCLE WHICH LIES BELOW THE FAILURE ENVELOPE REPRESENTS A
(NON-FAILURE) STABLE CONDITION.
6.
THE MOHR-COULOMB FAILURE CRITERION CAN BE WRITTEN AS THE EQUATION FOR
THE LINE THAT REPRESENTS THE FAILURE ENVELOPE. THE GENERAL EQUATION IS,
S = C + A TAN
WHERE,
S = SHEAR STRENGTH ON THE FAILURE PLANE.

DESCRIBE DIRECT SHEAR TEST. WHAT ARE ITS MERITS AND
DEMERITS ?
ANSWER
DIRECT SHEAR TEST :
1.
A DIRECT SHEAR TEST IS A LABORATORY OR FIELD TEST USED BY GEOTECHNICAL
ENGINEERS TO MEASURE THE SHEAR STRENGTH PROPERTIES OF SOIL OR ROCK
MATERIAL.
2
THE ORIGINAL FORM OF APPARATUS FOR THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF SHEAR FORCE IS
THE SHEAR BOX.
3.
THE APPARATUS CONSISTS OF A SQUARE BRASS BOX SPLIT HORIZONTALLY AT THE
LEVEL OF THE CENTER OF THE SOIL SAMPLE, WHICH IS HELD BETWEEN METAL GRILLES
AND POROUS STONES AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 4.15.1.
4.
VERTICAL LOAD IS APPLIED TO THE SAMPLE AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE. 4.15.1 AND IS
HELD CONSTANT DURING A TEST.
5.
A GRADUALLY INCREASING HORIZONTAL LOAD IS APPLIED TO THE LOWER PART OF THE
BOX UNTIL THE SAMPLE FAILS IN SHEAR.
6.
THE SHEAR LOAD AT FAILURE IS DIVIDED BY THE EROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE
SAMPLE TO GIVE THE ULTIMATE SHEARING STRENGTH.

MERITS : FOLLOWING ARE THE MERITS OF DIRECT SHEAR TEST :
1.
A DIRECT SHEAR MACHINE IS SIMPLE AND FAST TO OPERATE.
2.
DIRECT SHEAR REQUIREMENT IS MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AS COMPARED TO OTHER
TESTS.
3.
IT IS EASY TO TEST SANDS AND GRAVELS.
4.
LARGE SAMPLES CAN BE TESTED IN LARGE SHEAR BOXES, AS SMALL SAMPLES CAN
GIVE MISLEADING RESULTS.
DEMERITS : FOLLOWING ARE THE DEMERITS OF DIRECT SHEAR TEST :
1.
THE DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESS ALONG THE PREDETERMINED
FAILURE PLANE IS VERY COMPLEX.
2.
DRAINAGE CONDITION DURING THIS TEST CANNOT BE CONTROLLED AS THE WATER
CONTENT OF A SATURATED SOIL CHANGES RAPIDLY WITH STRESS.
3.
THE AREA OF THE FAILURE PLANE IS NOT CONSTANT DURING THE DIRECT SHEAR TEST.
THIS AREA WILL BE LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL AREA OF THE SOIL SPECIMEN.
4.
THE SOIL IS SHEARED ON A PREDETERMINED HORIZONTAL PLANE. THIS FORCED
PLANE IS NOT NECESSARILY THE WEAKEST PLANE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
LIMITATION OF THE DIRECT SHEAR TEST.
5.
THE EFFECT OF INTERNAL RESTRAINT BY THE SIDE WALLS OF THE SHEAR BOX IS LIKELY
TO AFFECT THE RESULTS.

OVER A TRIAXIAL TEST ?
07
ANSWER
UNCONFINED COMPRESSION TEST :
1.
UNCONFINED COMPRESSION OR UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION TEST IS A SPECIAL CASE OF
A TRIAXIAL TEST.
2.
THE UNCONFINED COMPRESSION TEST IS PERFORMED ON UNCONFINED CYLINDRICAL
SPECIMEN OF A COHESIVE SOIL TO MEASURE ITS UNCONFINED COMPRESSION
STRENGTH.
3.
IT IS CARRIED OUT WITHOUT ANY CONFINING PRESSURE AND THE TRIAXIAL CELL
ASSEMBLY IS NOT REQUIRED, MAKING THE TEST PROCEDURE SIMPLER.
4.
IT IS CARRIED OUT ON SATURATED CLAY SPECIMENS THAT CAN STAND UNSUPPORTED.
5.
THE CLAY SPECIMEN IS LOADED AXIALLY WHERE THE LOAD IS INCREASED TO FAILURE.
THE LOADING IS CARRIED OUT QUICKLY.

DESCRIBE THE VANE SHEAR TEST. WHAT ARE THE MERITS AND
DEMERITS OF VANE SHEAR TEST.
ANSWER
VANE SHEAR TEST :
1.
THIS TEST PROVIDES A SIMPLE AND QUICK METHOD OF DETERMINING THE
UNDRAINED (VANE) SHEAR STRENGTH OF RELATIVELY SOFT CLAYS.
2.
IT IS A ROTATIONAL SHEAR TEST, IN WHICH A CYLINDRICAL VOLUME OF CLAY IS MADE
TO ROTATE BY A CRUCIFORM VANE PUSHED INTO THE CLAY.
3.
THE OPPOSING SHEAR RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE CYLINDER AND THE SURROUNDING
MATERIAL IS DETERMINED FROM THE TORQUE APPLIED TO THE VANE, WHICH IS
MEASURED BY MEANS OF A CALIBRATED TORSION SPRING AND HENCE THE SHEAR
STRENGTH OF THE CLAY CAN BE CALCULATED.
4.
THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE SOIL IS DETERMINED USING THE FORMULA,
T = NS[D�H/2 + D�/6]
WHERE,
T = APPLIED TORQUE.
H = HEIGHT OF VANE.
D = DIAMETER OF VANE.
S = UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH.
MERITS : FOLLOWING ARE THE MERITS OF VANE SHEAR TEST :
1.
THE TEST IS SIMPLE AND QUICK.
2.
IT IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE IN-SITU UNDRAINED SHEAR
STRENGTH OF NON-FISSURED FULLY SATURATED CLAY.
3.
THE TEST CAN BE CONVENIENTLY USED TO DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE
SOIL.
DEMERITS : FOLLOWING ARE THE DEMERITS OF VANE SHEAR TEST :
1.
THE TEST CANNOT BE CONDUCTED ON THE FISSURED CLAY OR THE CLAY CONTAINING
SAND OR SILT LAMINATIONS.
2.
THE TEST DOES NOT GIVE ACCURATE RESULTS WHEN THE FAILURE ENVELOPE IS NOT
HORIZONTAL.

WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TRIAXIAL
COMPRESSION TEST ?
10


4-23 A ()
ANSWER
ADVANTAGES : FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES OF TRIAXIAL
COMPRESSION TEST:
1.
THERE IS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE DRAINAGE CONDITIONS. TESTS CAN BE
EASILY CONDUCTED FOR ALL THREE TYPES OF DRAINAGE CONDITIONS.
2.
PORE PRESSURE CHANGES AND THE VOLUMETRIC CHANGES CAN BE MEASURED
DIRECTLY.
3.
THE STRESS DISTRIBUTION ON THE FAILURE PLANE IS UNIFORM.
4.
THE SPECIMEN IS FREE TO FAIL ON THE WEAKEST PLANE.
5.
THE STATE OF STRESS AT ALL INTERMEDIATE STAGES UPTO FAILURE IS KNOWN. THE
MOHR CIRCLE CAN BE DRAWN AT ANY STAGE OF SHEAR.
6.
THE TEST IS SUITABLE FOR ACCURATE RESEARCH WORK.
DISADVANTAGES : FOLLOWING ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION
TEST :
1.
THE APPARATUS IS ELABORATE, COSTLY AND BULKY.
2.
THE DRAINED TEST TAKES A LONGER PERIOD AS COMPARED WITH THAT IN A DIRECT
SHEAR TEST.
3.
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE SPECIMEN
ACCURATELY AT LARGE STRAINS, AS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SPECIMEN REMAINS
CYLINDRICAL DOES NOT HOLD GOOD.
4.
THE TEST SIMULATES ONLY AXIS-SYMMETRICAL PROBLEMS. IN THE FIELD, THE
PROBLEM IS GENERALLY 3-DIMENSIONAL. A GENERAL TEST IN WHICH ALL THE THREE
STRESSES ARE VARIED WOULD BE MORE USEFUL.
5.
THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SPECIMEN IN THE TEST IS ISOTROPIC WHEREAS IN THE
FIELD, THE CONSOLIDATION IS GENERALLY ANISOTROPIC.

DETERMINATION OF PARAMETER A AND B :
1.
PARAMETER B CAN BE DETERMINED IN A UU TEST. THE CELL PRESSURE IS
INCREASED BY AOG AND THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN PORE PRESSURE AUT IS
MEASURED IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE TRIAXIAL TEST. THEN, B = AUR/DOJ
2.
PARAMETER A IS MEASURED DURING THE SECOND STAGE OF THE TRIAXIAL TEST. IF
IS THE PORE PRESSURE INCREASE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEVIATOR STRESS OF
(AO, - AAG) WITH CELL PRESSURE BEING CONSTANT, A = AU2 (AO, - 4O3). FOR
ACOMPLETELY SATURATED SOIL, A = A
3.
FOR A FULLY SATURATED SOIL, PARAMETER A CAN ALSO BE DETERMINED EASILY IN

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EARTH PRESSURE ? GIVE
EXAMPLES.
ANSWER
TYPES OF EARTH PRESSURE : LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE CAN BE GROUPED INTO
THREE CATEGORIES, DEPENDING UPON THE MOVEMENT OF THE RETAINING WALL
WITH RESPECT TO THE SOIL RETAINED :
1.
AT-REST PRESSURE :
I.
THE LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE IS CALLED AT-REST PRESSURE WHEN THE SOIL MASS
IS NOT SUBJECTED TO ANY LATERAL YIELDING OR MOVEMENT.
II.
THIS CASE OCCURS WHEN THE RETAINING WALL IS FIRMLY FIXED AT ITS TOP AND IS
NOT ALLOWED TO ROTATE OR MOVE LATERALLY.
III.
FIGURE. I.1.1(A) SHOWS THE BASEMENT RETAINING WALLS WHICH ARE RESTRAINED
AGAINST THE MOVEMENT BY THE BASEMENT SLAB PROVIDED AT THEIR TOPS.
2.
ACTIVE PRESSURE :
I.
A STATE OF ACTIVE PRESSURE OCCURS WHEN THE SOIL MASS YIELDS IN SUCH A
WAY THAT IT TENDS TO STRETCH HORIZONTALLY.
II.
A RETAINING WALL WHEN MOVES AWAY FROM THE BACKFILL, THERE IS A STRETCHING
OF THE SOIL MASS AND THE ACTIVE STATE OF EARTH PRESSURE EXISTS.
III.
IN FIGURE. 5.1.1(B), THE ACTIVE PRESSURE DEVELOPS ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE
WHEN THE WALL MOVES TOWARDS LEFT.
3.
PASSIVE PRESSURE :
I.
A STATE OF PASSIVE PRESSURE EXISTS WHEN THE MOVEMENT OF THE WALL IS
SUCH THAT THE SOIL TENDS TO COMPRESS HORIZONTALLY.
�I.
IN FIGURE. 5.1.1(B), THE PASSIVE PRESSURE DEVELOPS ON THE LEFT-SIDE OF THE WALL
BELOW THE GROUND LEVEL, AS THE SOIL IN THIS ZONE IS COMPRESSED WHEN THE

EXPLAIN THE TYPES OF SLOPES OF EARTH SURFACE.
ANSWER
TYPES OF SLOPES :
A.
ON THE BASIS OF METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION:
1.
NATURAL SLOPES :
I
THE SLOPES FORMED DUE TO NATURAL PROCESS AND EXIST NATURALLY ARE CALLED
NATURAL SLOPES.
IL
NATURAL SLOPES ARE THOSE THAT EXIST IN NATURE AND ARE FORMED BY NATURAL
CAUSES. SUCH SLOPES EXIST IN HILLY AREAS.
2
ARTIFICIAL SLOPES :
I
THE SLOPES FORMED BY UNNATURAL PROCESS. ARTIFICIAL SLOPES ARE FORMED BY
HUMANS AS PER REQUIREMENTS.
IL
THE SIDES OF CUTTINGS. THE SLOPES OF EMBANKMENTS CONSTRUCTED FOR ROADS,
RAILWAY LINES, CANALS ETC., AND THE SLOPES OF EARTH DAMS CONSTRUCTED FOR
STORING WATER ARE EXAMPLES OF MANMADE SLOPES.
B. ON THE BASIS OF TYPE OF SOIL :
1.
COHESIVE SOIL SLOPE : HAVING PURELY COHESIVE SOIL AS ITS CONTENT. IT IS
ALSO KNOWN AS COHESIVE SOIL SLOPE.
2
FRICTIONAL SOIL SLOPE : SLOPES HAVING FRICTIONAL SOIL AS ITS CONTENTS. IT IS
ALSO KNOWN AS FRICTIONAL SOIL SLOPE.
3.
COHESIVE-FRICTIONAL SOIL SLOPE : SLOPES MADE UP OF SOIL WHICH HAS
BOTH FRICTIONAL AS WELL AS COHESIVE PROPERTIES. IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS C-0 SOIL
SLOPE.
QUE 5.11.
WHAT ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN SLOPE STABILITY
ANALYSIS ?
ANSWER
ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS :
1.
THE PROBLEM IS TREATED AS TWO DIMENSIONAL, I.E., NO SHEAR STRESSES ARE
ASSUMED TO BE EXISTING ACROSS THE PLANE OF CROSS-SECTION OF THE
EMBANKMENT.
2.
THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE SOIL IS KNOWN, AND CAN BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS
OF COULOMB'S LAW; I.E.,
=

()
EARTH PRESSURE AND STABILITY OF SLOPES
WHERE, C AND & REPRESENT THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE VALUES OF COHESION AND
ANGLE OF FRICTION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE HOMOGENEOUS EMBANKED SOIL.
1
WHEN DIFFERENT SOILS ARE USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ERNHANKMENT,
SUCH AS IN A NON-HOMOGENEOUS ZONED EMBANKMENT, THE MATERIAL IN
EACH ZONE IS REPRESENTED BY A DIFFERENT COULOMB'S EQUATION FOR SHEAR
STRENGTH, USING C AND T VALUES OF THE RESPECTIVE ZONE.
4
IF ANY WATER IS SEEPING THROUGH THE EMBANKMENT, CAUSING ADDITIONAL
DISTURBING FORCES, THEN IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE FLOWNET FOR THE SEEPAGE IS
ALREADY KNOWN, SO THAT THE SEEPAGE STRESSES CAN BE EVALUATED.
WITH THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE CAN ANALYSIS AND EXAMINE THE STABILITY OF
EARTHEN SLOPES WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF ACCURACY.
QUE 5.12.

2. IN THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD, THE FORCES BETWEEN THE SLICES ARE NEGLECTED
AND EACH SLICE IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT COLUMN OF SOIL OF UNIT
THICKNESS.
3.
IF SLICE NUMBER 4 IS TAKEN AS A TYPICAL SLICE, THE WEIGHT OF THE SLICE WI IS
CALCULATED AS EQUAL TO YHB.
WHERE,
Y = BULK UNIT WEIGHT OF THE SOIL.
H = HEIGHT OF THE SLICE.
B = WIDTH OF SLICE.
4. THE LINE OF ACTION WHICH CAN BE TAKEN TO PASS THROUGH THE MID-WIDTH
POINT OF THE SLICE, MEETS THE BASE OF THE SLICE OF LENGTH / AT P.
5.
THE WEIGHT W IS PLOTTED AS A VECTOR PQ AND THEN RESOLVED INTO ITS NORMAL
AND TANGENTIAL COMPONENTS N AND T, RESPECTIVELY, AT P.
6.
SINCE THE NORMAL COMPONENT N PASSES THROUGH P AND THE CENTRE OF
ROTATION O. IT DOES NOT HAVE A DRIVING MOMENT, BUT MOBILIZE FRICTIONAL
RESISTANCE ALONG THE SLIP SURFACE.
7.
THE TANGENTIAL COMPONENT T CAUSES THE ROTATING MOMENT. IN THE END
SLICE, SUCH AS SLICE NUMBER 1 IN FIGURE. 5.17.1, THE TANGENTIAL COMPONENT
MAY ACT IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION, CAUSING A RESTORING MOMENT.
8.
T IS TAKEN AS POSITIVE WHEN CAUSING A DRIVING MOMENT AND NEGATIVE
WHEN CAUSING A RESISTING MOMENT.
9.
THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF T WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE
DRIVING MOMENT.
10. CONSIDERING THE WHOLE SLIP SURFACE AB OF LENGTH L. THE TOTAL DRIVING AND
RESISTING FORCES ARE :
