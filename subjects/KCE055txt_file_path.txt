FIGURE. 1.1.1. THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE.
HYDROLOGIC CYCLE IS THE PROCESS OF TRANSFER OF MOISTURE FROM THE
ATMOSPHERE TO THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF PRECIPITATION, CONVEYANCE OF
THE PRECIPITATED WATER BY STREAMS AND RIVERS TO OCEAN AND LAKES ETC.,
AND EVAPORATION OF WATER BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS SHOWN IN
FIGURE. 1.1.1.
THIS CYCLE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PROCESSES :
1.
EVAPORATION AND TRANSPIRATION (E) : THE WATER FROM THE SURFACES
OF OCEAN, RIVERS, LAKES AND ALSO FROM THE MOIST SOIL EVAPORATES. THE

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
1-3 C (CE-SEM-4)
VAPOURS ARE CARRIED OVER THE LAND BY AIR IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS.
TRANSPIRATION IS THE PROCESS OF WATER BEING LOST FROM THE LEAVES OF
THE PLANTS FROM THEIR PORES. THUS THE TOTAL EVAPORATION (E). INCLUSIVE
OF THE TRANSPIRATION CONSISTS OF:
I.
SURFACE EVAPORATION.
WATER SURFACE EVAPERATION.
A
FROM RIVER SURFACE.
B.
FROM OCEANS.
III.
EVAPORATION FROM PLANTS AND LEAVES (TRANSPIRATION).
IV. ATMOSPHERIC EVAPORATION.
2
PRECIPITATION (P): PRECIPITATION MAY BE DEFINED AS THE FALL OF MOISTURE
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE EARTH SURFACE IN ANY FORM. PRECIPITATION
MAY BE OF TWO FORMS :
I
LIQUID PRECIPITATION : I.E. RAINFALL.
II
FROZEN PRECIPITATION : THIS CONSISTS OF :
A SNOW.
B. HAIL.
C. SLEET.
D FREEZING RAIN.
3. RUNOFF (R) : RUNOFF IS THAT PORTION OF PRECIPITATION THAT IS NOT
EVAPORATED WHEN MOISTURE FALLS TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE AS PRECIPITATION,
A PART OF IT IS EVAPORATED FROM THE WATER SURFACE, SOIL AND VEGETATION
AND THROUGH TRANSPIRATION BY PLANTS. AND THE REMAINDER PRECIPITATION
IS AVAILABLE AS RUNOFF WHICH ULTIMATELY RUNS TO THE OCEAN THROUGH SURFACE
OR SUB-SURFACE STREAMS. THUS RUNOFF MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS :
I.
SURFACE RUNOFF : WATER FLOWS OVER THE LAND AND IS FIRST TO REACH THE
STREAMS AND RIVERS, WHICH ULTIMATELY DISCHARGE THE WATER TO THE SEA.
II. INTER-FLOW OR SUB-SURFACE RUNOFF : A PORTION OF PRECIPITATION
INFILTRATES INTO SURFACE SOIL AND DEPENDING UPON THE GEOLOGY OF THE
BASINS, RUNS AS SUB-SURFACE RUNOFF AND REACHES THE STREAMS AND RIVERS.
III. GROUNDWATER FLOW OR BASE FLOW : IT IS THAT PORTION OF PRECIPITATION,
WHICH AFTER INFILTRATION, PERCOLATES DOWN AND JOINS THE GROUNDWATER
RESERVOIR WHICH IS ULTIMATELY CONNECTED TO THE OCEAN.
THUS, THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE MAY BE EXPRESSED BY THE FOLLOWING SIMPLIFIED
EQUATION :
PRECIPITATION (P) = EVAPORATION (E) + RUNOFF (R)

STATEMENT "KNOWLEDGE OF HYDROLOGY IS MUST FOR ANY WATER RESOURCE
PLANNING".
10
ANSWER
HYDROLOGY :

1-4 C ((CE-SEM-8)

1.
IT IS THE SCIENCE THAT DEALS WITH THE OCCURRENCE, CIRCULATION AND
DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENT OF WATER ON THE EARTH, INCLUDING THAT IN THE
ATMOSPHERE AND BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.
2.
AS A BRANCH OF EARTH SCIENCE, IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE WATER IN STREAMS
AND LAKES, RAINFALL AND SNOWFALL. SNOW AND ICE ON THE LAND AND WATER
OCCURRING BELOW THE EARTH'S SURFACE IN THE PORES OF THE SOIL AND ROCKS.
KNOWLEDGE OF HYDROLOGY :
THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SCIENCE IS A MUST FOR EVERY CIVIL ENGINEER,
PARTICULARLY THE ONE WHO IS ENGAGED IN THE DESIGN. PLANNING OR
CONSTRUCTION OF IRRIGATION STRUCTURES, BRIDGES, AND HIGHWAY CULVERTS, OR
FLOOD CONTROL WORKS, ETC.
1.
MAXIMUM FLOWS, AFTER DIFFERENT YEARS, ARE EXPECTED AT A SPILLWAY OR A
HIGHWAY CULVERT IN A CITY DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
2.
MINIMUM RESERVOIR CAPACITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE ADEQUATE WATER
FOR IRRIGATION OR MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY, DURING DROUGHTS.
QUE 1.3.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF WATER BUDGET EQUATION IN
HYDROLOGY ? ALSO GIVE THE EXPRESSION FOR THE WATER BUDGET OF
CATCHMENT FOR A TIME INTERVAL AT AND WRITE IN BRIEF ABOUT ALL THE
ASSOCIATED TERMS IN THIS EQUATION.
ANSWER
PURPOSE OF WATER BUDGET EQUATION :
1.
LARGE CITIES AND URBAN SPRAWL PARTICULARLY AFFECT LOCAL CLIMATE AND
HYDROLOGY.
2.
URBANIZATION IS ACCOMPANIED BY ACCELERATED DRAINAGE OF WATER THROUGH
ROAD DRAINS AND CITY SEWER SYSTEMS, WHICH EVEN INCREASES THE MAGNITUDE
OF URBAN FLOOD EVENTS.
3.
THIS ALTERS THE RATES OF INFILTRATION, EVAPORATION, AND TRANSPIRATION THAT
WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR IN A NATURAL SETTING.
4.
THE REPLENISHING OF GROUND WATER AQUIFERS DOES NOT OCCUR OR OCCURS AT A
SLOWER RATE.
5.
TOGETHER, THESE VARIOUS EFFECTS DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN THE
SYSTEM AND CAN RESULT IN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR RIVER
WATERSHEDS, LAKE LEVELS, AQUIFERS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS A WHOLE.
6.
THEREFORE, IT IS VITAL TO LEARN ABOUT THE WATER BUDGET EQUATION WHICH
CONSISTS OF INFLOWS, OUTFLOWS, AND STORAGE.

WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY PRECIPITATION ? EXPLAIN
VARIOUS TYPES OF PRECIPITATION.

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
1-7C (CE-SEM-4)
ANSWER
PRECIPITATION : TO THE HYDROLOGIST, PRECIPITATION IS THE GENERAL TERM
FOR ALL FORMS OF MOISTURE EMANATING FROM THE CLOUDS AND FALLING TO
THE GROUND.
TYPES OF PRECIPITATION :
1.
CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION : CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION RESULTS FROM LIFTING
OF AIR MASSES CONVERGING INTO LOW PRESSURE AREA OF CYCLONE. THE
CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION MAY BE DIVIDED INTO (A) FRONTAL PRECIPITATION,
AND (B) NON-FRONTAL PRECIPITATION.
2
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION :
I.
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION IS CAUSED BY NATURAL RISING OF WARMER LIGHTER
AIR IN COLDER, DENSER SURROUNDINGS.
IL
THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE MAY RESULT FROM UNEQUAL HEATING AT
THE SURFACE, UNEQUAL COOLING AT THE TOP OF THE AIR LAYER, OR MECHANICAL
LIFTING WHEN AIR IS FORCED TO PASS OVER DENSER COLDER AIR MASSES.
ILL. CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION IS SPOTTY AND ITS INTENSITY MAY VARY FROM
LIGHT SHOWERS TO CLOUD BURSTS.
3.
OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION :
I.
OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION IS DUE TO THE LIFTING OF WARM MOISTURE LADEN
AIR MASSES DUE TO TOPOGRAPHIC BARRIERS (SUCH AS MOUNTAINS).
II.
AS IT REACHES HIGHER ELEVATION, IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH COLD AIR AND
PRECIPITATION OCCURS.
III.
THE ZONE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN WILL BE THE ZONE OF RAIN
SHADOW AREA WHERE THE RAINFALL MAY NOT OCCUR, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 1.6.1.
IV.
ALL THE PRECIPITATION WE HAVE IN HIMALAYAN REGION IS BECAUSE OF THE
OROGRAPHIC ASCENT OF AIR MASSES, RICH IN MOISTURE CONTENT BECAUSE OF
THEIR LONG TRAVEL OVER OCEANS.

I.
AIR MASS IS FORCED TO RISE UP DUE TO GREATER FRICTION OF EARTH SURFACE
AFTER ITS TRAVEL OVER OCEAN.
II.
THE AIR MASS RISES UP BECAUSE OF INCREASED TURBULENCE AND FRICTION,
WHEN IT ULTIMATELY CONDENSES AND PRECIPITATION OCCURS.

FOLLOWING ARE THE METHODS OF DETERMINING THE AVERAGE RAINFALL OVER
A CATCHMENT :

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
1-15 C (CE-SEM-4)
1.
ARITHMETIC AVERAGE METHOD :
I.
IF THE RAINFALL IS UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED ON ITS AREAL PATTERN, THE SIMPLEST
METHOD OF ESTIMATING AVERAGE RAINFALL IS TO COMPUTE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE
OF THE RECORDED RAINFALL VALUES AT VARIOUS STATIONS.
II.
THUS, IF P, P2,PS
PR ETC., ARE THE PRECIPITATION OR RAINFALL VALUES
N
MEASURED AT N GAUGE STATIONS, WE HAVE
P AV = + N 1
2
THIESSEN POLYGON METHOD :
O
I.
THE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE METHOD IS MOST APPROXIMATE METHOD SINCE
RAINFALL VARIES IN INTENSITY AND DURATION FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
II.
HENCE, RAINFALL RECORDED BY EACH RAIN-GAUGE STATION SHOULD BE WEIGHED
ACCORDING TO THE AREA IT IS ASSUMED TO REPRESENT.
III.
THIS METHOD IS A MORE COMMON METHOD OF WEIGHING THE RAIN-GAUGE
OBSERVATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AREA.
IV. THIS METHOD IS ALSO CALLED WEIGHTED MEAN METHOD AND IS MORE ACCURATE
THAN THE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE METHOD.
B
D:
FIGURE. 1.13.1. THIESSEN POLYGON METHOD.
PROCEDURE
I.
JOIN THE ADJACENT RAIN-GAUGE STATIONS, A, B, C, D, ETC., BY STRAIGHT
LINES.
II.
CONSTRUCT THE PERPENDICULAR BISECTORS OF EACH OF THESE LINES.
III. A THIESSEN NETWORK IS THUS CONSTRUCTED. THE POLYGON FORMED BY THE
PERPENDICULAR BISECTORS AROUND A STATION ENCLOSES AN AREA WHICH IS
EVERYWHERE CLOSER TO THAT STATION THAN TO ANY OTHER STATION. FIND THE
AREA OF EACH OF THESE POLYGONS SHOWN HATCHED IN FIGURE. 1.13.1.
IV.
MULTIPLY THE AREA OF EACH THIESSEN POLYGON BY THE RAIN-GAUGE VALUE
OF ENCLOSED STATION.
V.
FIND THE TOTAL AREA (DA) OF THE BASIN.
VI.
COMPUTE THE AVERAGE PRECIPITATION OR RAINFALL FROM THE EQUATION
:
= + A2P2 + + A,P, = (A, DA, X P,)
A1+A2....+A,

1-16 C (CE-SEM-8)

3.
ISOHYETAL METHOD :
I.
THE BASIC ASSUMPTION IN THE THIESSEN POLYGON METHOD IS THAT A RAIN-
GAUGE STATION BEST REPRESENTS THE AREA WHICH IS CLOSE TO IT.
II.
HOWEVER, THIS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE VALID, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAINFALL
IS CONTROLLED BY TOPOGRAPHY OR RESULTS FROM INTENSE CONVECTION.
III.
THE ISOHYETAL METHOD IS THE MOST ELABORATE AND ACCURATE IN SUCH
CONDITIONS.
IV. AN ISOHYET IS A LINE, ON A RAINFALL MAP OF THE BASIN, JOINING PLACES OF
EQUAL RAINFALL READINGS.
V,
AN ISOHYETAL MAP SHOWING CONTOURS OF EQUAL RAINFALL PRESENTS A MORE
ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION OVER THE BASIN.

PREPARE THE ISOHYETAL MAP FOR STORM CAUSING THE RAINFALL OVER THE
AREA.
II.
MEASURE THE AREA ENCLOSED BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE ISOHYETS WITH THE
HELP OF PLANIMETER.

GRID POINT METHOD :
I.
IN THIS METHOD, ALL THE GRID STATIONS ARE MARKED ON THE MAP OF THE
BASIN, ALONG WITH THE DEPTH OF PRECIPITATION.

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
1-17C (CE-SEM-4)
II.
ON THIS MAP, DRAWN TO A SUITABLE SCALE, A UNIFORM RECTANGULAR GRID AT
SOME SUITABLE SPACING IS SUPERIMPOSED.
III.
AT THE CORNERS OF THE GRID POINTS, PRECIPITATION IS ESTIMATED SUITABLY
BY CONSIDERING THE WEATHER AND STORM CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BASIN.
IV.
THE AVERAGE PRECIPITATION OF THE FOUR GRID CORNERS IS THEN MULTIPLIED
BY THE AREA OF THE GRID, TO GIVE THE AVERAGE PRECIPITATION VOLUME OF
THE GRID.
V.
THE SUM OF ALL SUCH PRODUCTS DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL AREA OF THE BASIN
WILL GIVE THE AVERAGE PRECIPITATION FOR THE BASIN.

WHAT IS MEANT BY PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION
(PMP) OVER A BASIN ? EXPLAIN HOW PMP IS ESTIMATED.
05
10
ANSWER
A.
PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION :
1.
THE PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION, COMMONLY KNOWN AS PMP, FOR
A REGION IS THE PRECIPITATION RESULTING FROM THE MOST CRITICAL
METEOROLOGICAL COMBINATIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERED PROBABLE OF OCCURENCE.
2.
IT CAN BE DEFINED AS THAT RAINFALL OVER A BASIN WHICH WOULD PRODUCE
THE FLOOD FLOW WITH VIRTUALLY NO RISK OF BEING EXCEEDED.
3.
FROM THE STATISTICAL STUDIES, PMP CAN ALSO BE ESTIMATED FROM THE
FOLLOWING EQUATION :
PMP = P + KO
WHERE,
P = MEAN OF ANNUAL MAXIMUM RAINFALL SERIES.
0 = STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE SERIES.
K = FREQUENCY FACTOR, WHICH IS USUALLY IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF 15.
B. MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM RAINFALL : THE MAGNITUDES OF MAXIMUM
RAINFALL AND MINIMUM RAINFALL WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD CAN BE
DETERMINED BY THE USE OF FREQUENCY FORMULA GIVEN BY HAZEN :

T =
2M - 1 M - 0.5
WHERE, T = RECURRENCE INTERVAL WITHIN WHICH THE EVENT IS EITHER
EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
1-25 C (CE-SEM-4)
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF MAXIMUM RAINFALL :
1.
ARRANGE THE RAINFALL DATA IN DESCENDING ORDER AND ASSIGN RANK NUMBER
(M) TO EACH RAINFALL EVENT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EVENT BEING EQUAL TO N.
2.
COMPUTE RECURRENCE INTERVAL (T) FOR EACH EVENT.
3.
PLOT A GRAPH BETWEEN RECURRENCE INTERVAL (T) AS ABSCISSA AND
CORRESPONDING RAINFALL AS ORDINATE.
4.
DETERMINE THE EXPECTED MAXIMUM RAINFALL MAGNITUDE FOR ANY DESIRED
VALUE OF T FROM THIS GRAPH.
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF MINIMUM RAINFALL :
1.
ARRANGE THE RAINFALL DATA IN ASCENDING ORDER AND ASSIGN RANK NUMBER
(M) TO EACH RAINFALL EVENT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EVENTS BEING EQUAL TO
N.
2.
COMPUTE RECURRENCE INTERVAL (T) FOR EACH EVENT.

DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE VARIOUS ABSTRACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE
PRECIPITATION.
05
ANSWER
ABSTRACTIONS FROM PRECIPITATION : WHEN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE
ON LAND SURFACE WHOLE OF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS RUNOFF BECAUSE OF LOSSES
THAT TAKE PLACE DURING OR AFTER THE PRECIPITATION. IMPORTANT LOSSES CONSIST
OF,
I.
INTERCEPTION.
II. EVAPORATION.
III. TRANSPIRATION.
IV. INFILTRATION.
V.
DEPRESSION STORAGE. VI. WATERSHED LEAKAGE.

1-26 C (CE-SEM-8)

OUT OF THIS EVAPORATION TRANSPIRATION AND INFILTRATION ARE THE MAJOR
LOSSES.
1.
INTERCEPTION :
I.
IT
MAY BE DEFINED AS THAT AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION WATER WHICH IS
INTERCEPTED BY VEGETATIVE FOLIAGE, BUILDINGS AND OTHER OBJECTS LYING OVER
THE LAND SURFACE.
II.
INTERCEPTION DOES NOT REACH THE LAND SURFACE BUT IS RETURNED BACK TO THE
ATMOSPHERE BY EVAPORATION.
III.
THE INTERCEPTED PRECIPITATION MAY FOLLOW ONE OF THE THREE POSSIBLE
ROUTES :
A.
IT MAY BE RETAINED BY THE VEGETATION AS SURFACE STORAGE AND
RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE BY EVAPORATION; THIS IS KNOWN AS
INTERCEPTION LOSS.
B.
IT CAN DRIP OFF THE PLANT LEAVES TO JOIN THE GROUND SURFACE OR THE
SURFACE FLOW; THIS IS KNOWN AS THROUGHFALL.
C.
THE RAINWATER MAY RUN ALONG THE LEAVES AND BRANCHES AND DOWN
THE STEM TO REACH THE GROUND SURFACE. THIS PART IS CALLED STEMFLOW.
2.
DEPRESSION STORAGE :
I.
A CATCHMENT AREA GENERALLY HAS MANY DEPRESSIONS OF SHALLOW DEPTH AND
OF VARYING SIZE AND SHAPE.
II.
WHEN PRECIPITATION TAKE PLACE, WATER RUNS TOWARDS THESE DEPRESSIONS
AND FILL THEM BEFORE ACTUAL OVERLAND FLOW OR RUNOFF TOWARDS A STREAM
TAKES PLACE.
III.
DEPRESSION STORAGE DEPENDS ON A VAST NUMBER OF FACTORS. THE MAJOR
FACTORS ARE :
A.
THE TYPE OF SOIL.
B.
THE CONDITION OF THE SURFACE REFLECTING THE AMOUNT AND NATURE
OF DEPRESSION.
C.
THE SLOPE OF THE CATCHMENT.
D.
THE ANTECEDENT PRECIPITATION AS A MEASURE OF THE SOIL MOISTURE.
IV.
THE FOLLOWING RELATIONSHIP MAY BE USED FOR COMPUTING THE DEPRESSION
STORAGE,
=
WHERE,
VDA = VOLUME OF WATER STORED IN SURFACE DEPRESSION.
P. = RAINFALL EXCESS.
K = DEPRESSION STORAGE CAPACITY OF THE BASIN.
3.
WATERSHED LEAKAGE :
I.
ADJACENT BASINS ARE SEPARATED BY RIDGE LINES, SO THAT RAINFALL FALLING OVER
A BASIN FLOWS TOWARDS THE DRAINAGE LINES (I.E., STREAMS) OF THE BASIN.

DEFINE EVAPORATION. DISCUSS THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE
EVAPORATION FROM A WATER BODY.
10
ANSWER
A EVAPORATION : IT IS THE PROCESS IN WHICH A LIQUID CHANGES TO THE
GASEOUS STATE AT THE FREE SURFACE, BELOW THE BOILING POINT THROUGH THE
TRANSFER OF HEAT ENERGY.
B.
FACTORS : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE EVAPORATION FROM
THE WATER BODY :
1.
VAPOUR PRESSURE : THE RATE OF EVAPORATION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SATURATION VAPOUR PRESSURE AT THE WATER
TEMPERATURE, EW AND THE ACTUAL PRESSURE IN THE AIR, EA. THUS,
EL =CLEW-E =
(1.20.1)
WHERE,
EL = RATE OF EVAPORATION (MM/DAY).
C = CONSTANT.
EW AND E ARE IN MM OF MERCURY.
2 TEMPERATURE : OTHER FACTORS REMAINING THE SAME, THE RATE OF
EVAPORATION INCREASES WITH AN INCREASE IN THE WATER TEMPERATURE.
3.
WIND : WIND AIDS IN REMOVING THE EVAPORATED WATER VAPOUR FROM THE
ZONE OF EVAPORATION AND CONSEQUENTLY CREATES GREATER SCOPE FOR
EVAPORATION.
4.
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE : OTHER FACTORS REMAINING SAME, A DECREASE
IN THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE, AS IN HIGH ALTITUDES, INCREASES EVAPORATION

1-28 C (CE-SEM-8)

5.
SOLUBLE SALTS :
I.
WHEN A SOLUTE IS DISSOLVED IN WATER, THE VAPOUR PRESSURE OF THE
SOLUTION IS LESS THAN THAT OF PURE WATER AND HENCE CAUSES REDUCTION
IN THE RATE OF EVAPORATION.
II.
THE PERCENT REDUCTION IN EVAPORATION APPROXIMATELY CORRESPONDS TO
THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY.
6.
HEAT STORAGE IN WATER BODIES :
I.
DEEP WATER BODIES HAVE MORE HEAT STORAGE THAN SHALLOW ONES.
II.
A DEEP LAKE MAY STORE RADIATION ENERGY RECEIVED IN SUMMER AND
RELEASE IT IN WINTER CAUSING LESS EVAPORATION IN SUMMER AND MORE
EVAPORATION IN WINTER COMPARED TO A SHALLOW LAKE EXPOSED TO A SIMILAR
SITUATION.
III.
HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF HEAT STORAGE IS ESSENTIALLY TO CHANGE THE SEASONAL
EVAPORATION RATES AND THE ANNUAL EVAPORATION RATE IS SELDOM AFFECTED.

ANALYTICAL METHODS : FOLLOWING ARE THE THREE ANALYTICAL METHODS
FOR DETERMINATION OF LAKE EVAPORATION :
1.
WATER-BUDGET METHOD :

IT IS THE SIMPLEST METHOD AND IS ALSO THE LEAST RELIABLE.
II.
IT INVOLVES WRITING THE HYDROLOGICAL CONTINUITY EQUATION FOR THE LAKE
AND DETERMINING THE EVAPORATION FROM A KNOWLEDGE OR ESTIMATION OF
OTHER VARIABLE.

10
ANSWER
1 EVAPOTRANSPIRATION :
I
TRANSPIRATION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH WATER LEAVES THE BODY OF A
LIVITIZ PLANT AND REACHES THE ATMOSPHERE AS WATER VAPOUR.
E
WHILE TRANSPIRATION TAKES PLACE, THE LAND AREA IN WHICH PLANTS STAND
ALSO LOSE MOISTURE BY THE EVAPORATION OF WATER FROM SOIL AND WATER
BODIES.
IN
IN HYDROLOGY AND IRRIGATION PRACTICE, IT IS FOUND THAT EVAPORATION AND
TRANSPIRATION PROCESSES CAN BE CONSIDERED ADVANTAGEOUSLY UNDER ONE
HEAD AS EVAPOTRANSPIRATION.
2
CONSUMPTIVE USE: THE TERM CONSUMPTIVE USE IS ALSO USED TO DENOTE
THE LOSS BY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. FOR A GIVEN SET OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS,
REVAPOTRANSPIRATION OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF WATER.
3
POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION :
I
IF SUFFICIENT MOISTURE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE COMPLETELY TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF VEGETATION FULLY COVERING THE AREA, THE RESULTING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
IS CALLED POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (PET).
II.
POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION NO LONGER CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON THE SOIL
AND PLANT FACTORS BUT DEPENDS ESSENTIALLY ON THE CLIMATIC FACTORS.
4. ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION : THE REAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OCCURRING
IN A SPECIFIC SITUATION IS CALLED ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (AET).
5. FIELD CAPACITY : IT IS DEFINED AS THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF WATER
THAT THE SOIL CAN RETAIN AGAINST THE FORCE OF GRAVITY. ANY HIGHER MOISTURE
INPUT TO A SOIL AT FIELD CAPACITY SIMPLY DRAINS AWAY.
6.
PERMANENT WILTING POINT :
I.
IT IS THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF A SOIL AT WHICH THE MOISTURE IS NO LONGER
AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO SUSTAIN THE PLANTS.
II.
AT THIS STAGE, EVEN THOUGH THE SOIL CONTAINS SOME MOISTURE, IT WILL BE
SO HELD BY THE SOIL GRAINS THAT THE ROOTS OF THE PLANTS ARE NOT ABLE TO
EXTRACT IT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO SUSTAIN THE PLANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY
THE PLANTS WILT.

1-34 C (CE-SEM-8)

7. AVAILABLE WATER : THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIELD CAPACITY AND
PERMANENT WILTING POINT IS CALLED AVAILABLE WATER, THE MOISTURE FOR
PLANT GROWTH.
8.
DEPRESSION STORAGE : REFER Q. 1.19, PAGE 1-25C, UNIT-1.
9.
INTERCEPTION : REFER Q. 1.19, PAGE 1-25C, UNIT-1.
10. INFILTRATION CAPACITY : THE MAXIMUM RATE AT WHICH A GIVEN SOIL AT A
GIVEN TIME CAN ABSORB WATER IS DEFINED AS THE INFILTRATION CAPACITY. IT IS
DESIGNATED AS FP AND IS EXPRESSED IN UNITS OF CM/H. THE ACTUAL RATE OF
INFILTRATION CAN BE EXPRESSED AS
F = FP WHEN I FP
F = I WHEN I < FP
THE INFILTRATION CAPACITY OF A SOIL IS HIGH AT THE BEGINNING OF A STORM AND
HAS AN EXPONENTIAL DECAY AS THE TIME ELAPSES.
11. INFILTRATION RATE : INFILTRATION RATE, AT ANY INSTANT IS THE RATE AT WHICH
WATER ACTUALLY ENTERS INTO THE SOIL DURING A STORM, AND IS EQUAL TO THE
INFILTRATION CAPACITY FP OR THE RAINFALL RATE, WHICHEVER IS LESS.
12. PAN COEFFICIENT : THE EVAPORATION OBSERVED FROM A PAN HAS TO BE
CORRECTED TO GET THE EVAPORATION FROM A LAKE UNDER SIMILAR CLIMATIC AND
EXPOSURE CONDITION THUS A CO-EFFICIENT IS INTRODUCED AS,
LAKE EVAPORATION = CP PAN EVAPORATION.

PAGE 1-39C, UNIT-1.
1.
INFILTRATION INDEX : IT IS THE AVERAGE RATE OF LOSS SUCH THAT THE
VOLUME OF RAINFALL IN EXCESS OF THAT RATE WILL BE EQUAL TO THE DIRECT
RUNOFF. ESTIMATE OF RUNOFF VOLUME FROM LARGE AREAS HAVING
HETEROGENEOUS INFILTRATION LOSS AND RAINFALL CHARACTERISTICS, ARE MADE
BY USE OF INFILTRATION INDICES.
2.
D-INDEX :
I.
THE D-INDEX IS THE AVERAGE RAINFALL ABOVE WHICH THE RAINFALL VOLUME IS
EQUAL TO THE RUNOFF VOLUME.
II.
THE D-INDEX IS DERIVED FROM THE RAINFALL HYETOGRAPH WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE RESULTING RUNOFF VOLUME.
III.
THE INITIAL LOSS IS ALSO CONSIDERED AS INFILTRATION.
IV.
THE D-VALUE IS FOUND BY TREATING IT AS A CONSTANT INFILTRATION CAPACITY.
3.
W-INDEX :
I.
IN AN ATTEMPT TO REFINE THE 0-INDEX, THE INITIAL LOSSES ARE SEPARATED
FROM THE TOTAL ABSTRACTIONS AND AN AVERAGE VALUE OF INFILTRATION RATE,
CALLED W-INDEX, IS DEFINED AS,
P-R-IE
W =
(1.33.1)
WHERE,
P = TOTAL STORM PRECIPITATION (CM).
R = TOTAL STORM RUNOFF (CM).
1, = INITIAL LOSSES (CM).
A
TE = DURATION OF THE RAINFALL EXCESS, I.E., THE TOTAL
TIME IN WHICH THE RAINFALL INTENSITY IS GREATER
THAN W (IN HOURS).
W = DEFINED AVERAGE RATE OF INFILTRATION (CM).
II.
SINCE INITIAL LOSSES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN, THE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF
W-INDEX IS RATHER DIFFICULT.
III. THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THE W-INDEX OBTAINED UNDER VERY WET SOIL
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTING THE CONSTANT MINIMUM RATE OF INFILTRATION
OF THE CATCHMENT, IS KNOWN AS W

QUE 2.1.
DEFINE RUNOFF AND DISCUSS THE TYPES OF RUNOFF.
ANSWER
RUNOFF:
1.
RUNOFF MEANS THE DRAINING OR FLOWING OFF OF PRECIPITATION FROM A
CATCHMENT AREA THROUGH A SURFACE CHANNEL.
2.
IT REPRESENTS THE OUTPUT FROM THE CATCHMENT IN A GIVEN UNIT OF TIME.
TYPES OF RUNOFF : BASED ON THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN THE PRECIPITATION
AND THE RUNOFF, THE RUNOFF IS CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES AS :
1.
DIRECT RUNOFF:
I.
IT IS THAT PART OF THE RUNOFF WHICH ENTERS INTO THE STREAM IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE RAINFALL.
II.
IT INCLUDES SURFACE RUNOFF, PROMPT INTERFLOW AND RAINFALL ON THE SURFACE
OF THE STREAM.
III.
IN THE CASE OF SNOW-MELT, THE RESULTING FLOW ENTERING INTO THE STREAM
IS ALSO A DIRECT RUNOFF.
IV.
SOMETIMES TERMS SUCH AS DIRECT STORM RUNOFF AND STORM RUNOFF ARE
USED TO DESIGNATE DIRECT RUNOFF.
2
BASE FLOW :
I.
THE DELAYED FLOW THAT REACHES TO A STREAM ESSENTIALLY AS GROUNDWATER
FLOW IS CALLED BASE FLOW.
II.
MANY TIMES DELAYED INTERFLOW IS ALSO INCLUDED UNDER THIS CATEGORY.
III.
IN THE ANNUAL HYDROGRAPH OF A PERENNIAL STREAM, THE BASE FLOW IS
EASILY RECOGNIZED AS THE SLOWLY DECREASING FLOW OF THE STREAM IN RAINLESS
PERIODS.

ANSWER
A STUDY OF THE ANNUAL HYDROGRAPHS OF STREAMS ENABLES ONE TO CLASSIFY
STREAMS INTO THREE CLASSES AS :
1.
PERENNIAL STREAM :
I.
A PERENNIAL STREAM IS ONE WHICH ALWAYS CARRIES SOME FLOW IN IT FIGURE. 2.2.1.
II.
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GROUNDWATER FLOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
III. EVEN DURING THE DRY SEASONS THE WATERTABLE WILL BE ABOVE THE BED OF THE

INTERMITTENT STREAM :
I.
AN INTERMITTENT STREAM HAS LIMITED CONTRIBUTION FROM THE GROUNDWATER.
II.
DURING THE WET SEASON THE WATERTABLE IS ABOVE THE STREAM BED AND THERE
IS A CONTRIBUTION OF THE BASE FLOW TO THE STREAM FLOW.
III.
HOWEVER, DURING DRY SEASONS THE WATERTABLE DROPS TO A LEVEL LOWER THAN
THAT OF THE STREAM BED AND THE STREAM DRIES UP.
IV.
EXCEPTING FOR AN OCCASIONAL STORM WHICH CAN PRODUCE A SHORT-DURATION
FLOW, THE STREAM REMAINS DRY FOR THE MOST PART OF THE DRY MONTHS

WHAT IS RUNOFF ? WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE
RUNOFF FROM A CATCHMENT AREA ? DESCRIBE THE METHODS OF COMPUTING
RUNOFF FROM A CATCHMENT AREA.
10
ANSWER
RUNOFF : REFER Q. 2.1, PAGE 2-2C, UNIT-2.
FACTORS : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RUNOFF FROM A
CATCHMENT AREA :
1.
PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS :
I.
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR ON WHICH RUNOFF DEPENDS. IMPORTANT
PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE :
A.
INTENSITY.
B. DURATION.
C.
AERIAL DISTRIBUTION.
D. DIRECTION OF STORM MOVEMENT.
E.
FORM OF PRECIPITATION.
F. EVAPO-TRANSPIRATION.

2-6 C (CE-SEM-8)
RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS
II.
MORE THE RAINFALL MORE WILL BE THE RUNOFF. RUNOFF DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF
THE STORM CAUSING PRECIPITATION, AND ALSO UPON ITS DURATION.
III.
RUNOFF ALSO INCREASES WIT THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL. RUNOFF ALSO INCREASES
WITH THE EXTENT OF THE ST RM OVER THE CATCHMENT.
IV.
IF THE RAINFALL INTENSITY IS VERY LESS, AND IT RAINS AS LIGHT SHOWERS, MUCH OF
THE WATER WILL BE LOST IN INFILTRATION AND EVAPORATION ETC., AND THE RUNOFF
WILL BE LESS. GREATER EVAPO-TRANSPIRATION WILL RESULT IN LESSER RUNOFF.
V.
SIMILARLY, IF THE PRECIPITATION IS IN THE FORM OF SNOW, OR IF WATER FREEZES
AS IT FALLS, IT WILL BE RETAINED IN THE CATCHMENT TILL TEMPERATURE INCREASES.
THUS RUNOFF WILL BE LESS.
2
SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE CATCHMENT :
I.
THE RUNOFF FROM A CATCHMENT ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE, SHAPE AND
LOCATION OF THE CATCHMENT.
II.
MORE INTENSE RAINFALLS ARE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED OVER A RELATIVELY SMALLER
AREA A STREAM COLLECTING WATER FROM A SMALL CATCHMENT AREA IS LIKELY TO
GIVE GREATER RUNOFF INTENSITY PER UNIT AREA.
III.
IN THE CASE OF A VERY BIG CATCHMENT, UNIFORM RAIN SELDOM FALLS OVER THE
ENTIRE AREA, WITH THE RESULT THAT ONLY VERY FEW TRIBUTARIES OF THE STREAM
FEED WATER TO MAIN STREAM DURING A PARTICULAR STORM.
IV.
THUS RUNOFF INTENSITY OF LARGER STREAM, PER UNIT CATCHMENT AREA IS LESSER.
V.
IN THE CASE OF A FAN OR SECTOR SHAPED CATCHMENT FIGURE. 2.4.1(A) ALL THE
TRIBUTARIES ARE APPROXIMATELY OF THE SAME SIZE.
VI.
SUCH CATCHMENT GIVES GREATER RUNOFF SINCE THE PEAK FLOOD FROM THE
TRIBUTARIES IS LIKELY TO REACH THE MAIN STREAM APPROXIMATELY AT THE SAME
TIME.
VII. IN THE CASE OF A FERN LEAF CATCHMENT FIGURE. 2.4.1(B), THE TRIBUTARIES ARE
GENERALLY OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS, AND MEET THE MAIN STREAM AT THE REGULAR
INTERVALS.

3.
TOPOGRAPHY OF CATCHMENT :
I.
THE RUNOFF DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE SURFACE OF THE CATCHMENT IS SMOOTH
OR RUGGED.
II.
IF THE SURFACE SLOPE IS STEEP, WATER WILL FLOW QUICKLY, AND ABSORPTION AND
EVAPORATION LOSSES WILL BE LESS, RESULTING IN GREATER RUNOFF.

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
2-7C (CE-SEM-8)
III. IF THE CATCHMENT IS MOUNTAINOUS, AND IS ON THE WINDWARD SIDE OF THE
MOUNTAINS, THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL WILL BE MORE, AND HENCE RUNOFF WILL
ALSO BE MORE.
4.
ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED :
I.
THE ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED AFFECTS THE EVAPORATION AND TRANSPIRATION
LOSS BY INFLUENCING THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RECEIVED FROM THE SUN.
II.
THE NORTH AND SOUTH ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED AFFECTS THE MELTING TIME
OF COLLECTED SNOW AND HENCE THE RUNOFF.
III.
SIMILARLY, IN MOUNTAINOUS WATERSHED, THE WINDWARD SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
RECEIVES COMPARATIVELY HIGHER INTENSE RAINFALL THAN THE LEEWARD SIDE.

ANSWER
A.
HYDROGRAPH : A PLOT OF THE DISCHARGE IN A STREAM PLOTTED AGAINST TIME
CHRONOLOGICALLY IS CALLED A HYDROGRAPH.
B. COMPONENTS OF HYDROGRAPH : THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A
HYDROGRAPH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW :
1.
RISING LIMB :
I.
THE RISING LIMB OF A HYDROGRAPH, ALSO KNOWN AS CONCENTRATION CURVE
REPRESENTS THE INCREASE IN DISCHARGE DUE TO THE GRADUAL BUILDING UP OF
STORAGE IN CHANNELS AND OVER THE CATCHMENT SURFACE.
II.
THE INITIAL LOSSES AND HIGH INFILTRATION LOSSES DURING THE EARLY PERIOD OF
A STORM CAUSE THE DISCHARGE TO RISE RATHER SLOWLY IN THE INITIAL PERIODS.
III.
AS THE STORM CONTINUES, MORE AND MORE FLOW FROM DISTANT PARTS REACH
THE BASIN OUTLET.

IN. THE STORAGE OF WATER IN THE BASIN EXISTS AS (I) SURFACE STORAGE, WHICH
INCLUDES BOTH SURFACE DETENTION AND CHANNEL STORAGE, (II) INTERFLOW
STORAGE, AND (III) GROUNDWATER STORAGE, I.E., BASE-FLOW STORAGE.
QUE 26. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DESIGN FLOOD ? WHAT ARE THE FACTORS
AFFECTING THE FLOOD HYDROGRAPH ?
ANSWER
A DESIGN FLOOD : IT IS THE VALUE OF THE INSTANTANEORUS PEAK DISCHARGE
ADOPTED FOR THE DESIGN OF A PARTICULAR PROJECT OR ANY OF ITS STRUCTURE. THE
TERM DERIGN FLOOD IS USED TO DENOTE THE MAXIMUM FLOOD FLOW THAT COULD
BE PASSED WITHOUT DAMAGE OR SERIOUS THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF ENGINEERING
STRUCTURE.
B. FACTORS : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE FLOOD HYDROGRAPH :
1.
PHYSIOGRAPHIC FACTORS :
I
BASIN CHARACTERISTICS:
A SHAPE.
B. SIZE.
C. SLOPE.
D NATURE OF THE VALLEY.
E. ELEVATION.
F. DRAINAGE DENSITY.
II.
INFILTRATION CHARACTERISTICS: :
A
LAND UNE AND COVER.
B. SOIL TYPE AND GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS.
C.
LAKES, SWAMPS AND OTHER STORAGE.
III.
CHANNEL CHAARACTERITICS : CROSS-SECTION, ROUGHNESS, AND STORAGE CAPACITY.
2
CLIMATIC FACTORS :
I.
STORM CHARACTERISTICS: PRECIPITATION, INTENSITY, DURATION, MAGNITUDE,
AND MOVEMENT OF STORM.
II.
INITIAL LONA.
III. EVAPOTRANMPIRATION.
A.
SHAPE OF THE BASIN :
I.
THE SHAPE OF THE BASIN INFLUENCES THE TIME TAKEN FOR WATER FROM THE
REMOTE PARTS OF THE CATCHMENT TO ARRIVE AT THE OUTLET. THUS, THE OCCURRENCE
OF THE PEAK AND HENCE THE SHAPE OF THE HYDROGRAPH ARE AFFECTED BY THE
BASIN SHAPE.
II. FAN-SHAPED, I.E., NEARLY SEMI CIRCULAR SHAPED CATCHMENTS GIVE HIGH
PEAK AND NARROW HYDROGRAPHS WHILE ELONGATED CATCHMENTS GIVE BROAD
AND LOW-PEAKED HYDROGRAPHA.
4.
SIZE
I.
SMALL BASINS BEHAVE DIFFERENT FROM THE LARGE ONES IN TERMS OF THE
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS PHASEN OF THE RUNOFF PHENOMENON.

2-10 C (CE-SEM-8)
RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS
II.
IN SMALL CATCHMENTS, THE OVERLAND FLOW PHASE IS PREDOMINANT OVER THE
CHANNEL FLOW.
III.
HENCE THE LAND USE AND INTENSITY OF RAINFALL HAVE IMPORTANT ROLE ON
THE PEAK FLOOD. ON LARGE BASINS THESE EFFECTS ARE SUPPRESSED AS THE
CHANNEL FLOW PHASE IS MORE PREDOMINANT.
5.
SLOPE :
I.
THE SLOPE OF THE MAIN STREAM CONTROLS THE VELOCITY OF FLOW IN THE
CHANNEL.
II.
AS THE RECESSION LIMB OF THE HYDROGRAPH REPRESENTS THE DEPLETION OF
STORAGE, THE STREAM CHANNEL SLOPE WILL HAVE A PRONOUNCED EFFECT ON
THIS PART OF THE HYDROGRAPH.
III.
LARGE STREAM SLOPES GIVE RISE TO QUICKER DEPLETION OF STORAGE AND
HENCE RESULT IN STEEPER RECESSION LIMBS OF HYDROGRAPHS.
IV.
THE BASIN SLOPE IS IMPORTANT IN SMALL CATCHMENTS WHERE THE OVERLAND
FLOW IS RELATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT. IN SUCH CASES THE STEEPER SLOPE OF
THE CATCHMENT RESULTS IN LARGER PEAK DISCHARGES.
6.
DRAINAGE DENSITY :
I.
THE DRAINAGE DENSITY IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE TOTAL CHANNEL LENGTH
TO THE TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA.
II.
A LARGE DRAINAGE DENSITY CREATES SITUATION CONDUCIVE FOR QUICK DISPOSAL
OF RUNOFF DOWN THE CHANNELS.
III.
THIS FAST RESPONSE IS REFLECTED IN A PRONOUNCED PEAKED DISCHARGE.
IV.
IN BASINS WITH SMALLER DRAINAGE DENSITIES, THE OVERLAND FLOW IS PREDOMINANT
AND THE RESULTING HYDROGRAPH IS SQUAT WITH A SLOWLY RISING LIMB.
7.
CLIMATIC FACTORS :
I.
AMONG CLIMATIC FACTORS THE INTENSITY, DURATION, AND DIRECTION OF STORM
MOVEMENT ARE THE THREE IMPORTANT ONES AFFECTING THE SHAPE OF A FLOOD
HYDROGRAPH.
II.
FOR A GIVEN DURATION, THE PEAK AND VOLUME OF THE SURFACE RUNOFF ARE
ESSENTIALLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL.
III.
THIS ASPECT IS MADE USE OF IN THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH THEORY OF ESTIMATING
PEAK-FLOW HYDROGRAPHS.

ANSWER
A UNIT HYDROGRAPH :
1.
A UNIT HYDROGRAPH (OR UNIT-GRAPH) IS THE DIRECT RUNOFF HYDROGRAPH
RESULTING FROM ONE CENTIMETER (OR ONE MILLIMETER OR ONE INCH) OF EXCESS
RAINFALL GENERATED UNIFORMLY OVER A CATCHMENT AREA AT A CONSTANT RATE
FOR AN EFFECTIVE DURATION.
2
THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH FOR A CATCHMENT BASIN IS THE DIRECT RUNOFF
HYDROGRAPH PRODUCED BY A UNIT (USUALLY 1 CM) RAINFALL EXCESS FROM A
STORM OF D-HOUR DURATION AND THEREFORE, IS THE LUMPED RESPONSE OF THE
BASIN TO THE STORM.
B. ASSUMPTIONS : FOLLOWING ARE THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS IN THE UNIT
HYDROGRAPH THEORY :
1 THE EXCESS RAINFALL HAS A CONSTANT INTENSITY (1/D CM/HR) WITHIN EFFECTIVE
STORM DURATION OF D-HOURS.
2
THE EXCESS RAINFALL (GIVING RISE TO 1 CM DEPTH OF RUNOFF) IS UNIFORMLY
DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CATCHMENT BASIN.
3. THE BASE TIME OF DIRECT RUNOFF HYDROGRAPH (I.E., THE DURATION OF THE
DIRECT RUNOFF RESULTING FROM AN EXCESS RAINFALL OF GIVEN DURATION) IS
CONSTANT.
4 THE ORDINATES OF ALL DIRECT RUNOFF HYDROGRAPHS OF A COMMON BASE
TIME ARE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DIRECT RUNOFF
REPRESENTED BY EACH HYDROGRAPH.
5.
FOR A GIVEN CATCHMENT BASIN, THE HYDROGRAPH, RESULTING FROM A GIVEN
EXCESS RAINFALL REFLECTS THE UNCHANGING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CATCHMENT
BASIN.

ANSWER
A. HYDROGRAPH : REFER Q. 2.5, PAGE 2-7C, UNIT-2.
B. THEORY OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH : REFER Q. 2.8, PAGE 2-11C, UNIT-2.
C. LIMITATIONS OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH : FOLLOWING ARE THE LIMITATIONS TO
THE USE OF UNIT HYDROGRAPHS :
1.
PRECIPITATION MUST BE FROM RAINFALL ONLY. SNOW-MELT RUNOFFCANNOT BE
SATISFACTORY REPRESENTED BY UNIT HYDROGRAPH.
2.
THE CATCHMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE UNUSUALLY LARGE STORAGES IN TERMS OF
TANKS, PONDS, LARGE FLOOD-BANK STORAGES, ETC., WHICH AFFECT THE LINEAR
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STORAGE AND DISCHARGE.
3.
IF THE PRECIPITATION IS DECIDEDLY NON-UNIFORM, UNIT HYDROGRAPHS CAN
NOT BE EXPECTED TO GIVE GOOD RESULTS.
4.
IN THE USE OF UNIT HYDROGRAPHS VERY ACCURATE RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE
EXPECTED. VARIATIONS IN THE HYDROGRAPH BASE OF AS MUCH AS 1 20 % AND
IN THE PEAK DISCHARGE BY = 10 % ARE NORMALLY CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE.

HYDROGRAPH OF DIFFERENT DURATIONS.
OR
EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF S-HYDROGRAPH AND UNDER WHAT
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD ADOPTION OF THIS HYDROGRAPH. GIVE A CLEAR
ASSOCIATED SKETCH.
10
ANSWER
METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH
:
1.
IDEALLY, UNIT HYDROGRAPHS ARE DERIVED FROM SIMPLE ISOLATED STORMS AND
IF THE DURATION OF THE VARIOUS STORMS DO NOT DIFFER VERY MUCH, SAY
WITHIN A BAND OF = 20 % D, THEY WOULD ALL BE GROUPED UNDER ONE
AVERAGE DURATION OF D-H.
2.
IF IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS UNIT HYDROGRAPHS OF DIFFERENT DURATIONS ARE
NEEDED THEY ARE BEST DERIVED FROM FIELD DATA.
3.
LACK OF ADEQUATE DATA NORMALLY PRECLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF UNIT
HYDROGRAPHS COVERING A WIDE RANGE OF DURATIONS FOR A GIVEN CATCHMENT.
4.
UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS A D-HOUR UNIT HYDROGRAPH IS USED TO DEVELOP
UNIT HYDROGRAPHS OF DIFFERING DURATION ND.
5.
TWO METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE :
I.
METHOD OF SUPERPOSITION :
IF A D-H UNIT HYDROGRAPH IS AVAILABLE, AND IT IS DESIRED TO DEVELOP
A
A UNIT HYDROGRAPH OF ND-H, WHERE N IS AN INTEGER, IT IS EASILY
ACCOMPLISHED BY SUPERPOSING N UNIT HYDROGRAPHS WITH EACH GRAPH
SEPARATED FROM THE PREVIOUS ON BY D-H. FIGURE. 2.16.1 SHOWS THREE
4H UNIT HYDROGRAPHS A, B AND C.
CURVE B BEGINS 4 H AFTER A AND C BEGINS 4-H, AFTER B.
B.
THUS THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE CURVES IS A DRH OF 3 CM DUE
TO AN EXCESS RAINFALL (ER) OF 12-H DURATION. IF THE ORDINATES OF THIS
DRH ARE NOW DIVIDED BY 3, ONE OBTAINS A 12-H UNIT HYDROGRAPH.

DESCRIBE HOW SNYDER'S SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH IS DERIVED.
OR

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
2-27 C (CE-SEM-8)
HOW WILL YOU DERIVE THE SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH FROM A NUMBER
OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH ? ILLUSTRATE THE METHOD WITH SUITABLE EXAMPLE
IN A TABULAR FORM.
10
ANSWER
A.
SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH :
1.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT IF THE RAINFALL AND RUNOFF RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE, UNIT
HYDROGRAPHS CAN BE DERIVED.
2.
HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF UNGAUGED RIVERS, THESE DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
IN SOME OTHER CASES, THE DATA AVAILABLE MAY BE SCANTY.
3.
FOR SUCH CATCHMENTS, UNIT HYDROGRAPHS ARE DERIVED BY RELATING THE
SELECTED BASIN CHARACTERISTICS TO THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH SHAPE.
4.
THE RESULTING HYDROGRAPH, DERIVED FROM BASIN CHARACTERISTIES
RELATIONSHIP IS KNOWN AS A SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH.
B.
SNYDER'S METHOD :
1.
SNYDER STUDIED THE DATA OF CATCHMENTS OF APPALACHIAN HIGHLANDS OF
EASTERN UNITED STATES, AND THEN DEVELOPED EMPIRICAL EQUATIONS FOR
SYNTHETIC HYDROGRAPH.
2.
SNYDER SELECTED THREE PARAMETERS OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH :
I.
BASE WIDTH, TB
II.
PEAK DISCHARGE, QP
III.
BASIN LAG, TZ.

FIGURE. 2.21.1. PARAMETERS OF SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH
3.
THE EQUATIONS GIVEN BY HIM TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CATCHMENT AREA, SHAPE
OF BASIN, TOPOGRAPHY, CHANNEL SLOPES, STREAM DENSITY AND CHANNEL
STORAGE.

(CE-SEM-S)
RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS
4
HE ELIMINATED ALL THESE PARAMETERS EXCEPT THE FIRST TWO. BY INCLUDING
THEM IN A SINGLE CO-EFFICIENT C.
5
HE DEALT WITH THE SUSE AND SHAPE OF THE CATCHMENT BY MEASURING THE
LENGTH OF THE MAIN STREAM CHANNEL. BY PROPOSING THE FOLLOWING EQUATION
FOR BASIN LAG
: = CA, X LIRS
-
(2.21.1)
WHERE,
I = BASIN LAG IN HOURS, (BASIN LAG IS THE TIME
BETWEEN MASS OF CENTRE OF UNIT RAINFALL OF T
HOUR DURATION AND RUNOFF PEAK FLOW)
C. = A CO-EFFICIENT DEPENDING UPON UNITS AND
11
DRAINAGE BASIN CHARACTERISTICS (1.35 - 1.65).
L = DISTANCE FROM STATION TO CATCHMENT BOUNDARY
1'
MEASURED ALONG THE MAIN STREAM, IN KM.
LEE = DISTANCE ALONG THE MAIN STREAM FROM GAUGING
STATION TO A POINT OPPOSITE THE CENTROID OF THE
WATERSHED. IN KM.
6.
THE PEAK DISCHARGE OF Q, UNIT HYDROGRAPH OF STANDARD DURATION T IS
GIVEN BY,
R,=2.77CC,A =
(2.21.2)
WHERE,
QP = PEAK DISCHARGE (M�/SEC).
A = CATCHMENT AREA (KM�).
CP = A REGIONAL CONSTANT, RANGING FROM 0.56 TO 0.69.
7.
SNYDER ADOPTED THE STANDARD DURATION (T) HOURS OF EFFECTIVE RAINFALL
GIVEN BY,
T = = (2/11)TL
(2.21.3)
8.
THE DURATION OF SURFACE RUNOFF OR THE BASE LENGTH TB OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH
IS GIVEN BY,
TC=3+3(24)(DAYS)
=
+
WHEN TB IS EXPRESSED IN HOURS,
TB ==72+341 =
(2.21.4)
(WHERE BOTH T AND 11. ARE IN HOURS)
9.
IT IS FOUND THAT EQUATION (2.21.4) GIVES UNREASONABLY LONG BASE PERIODS
FOR SMALL CATCHMENTS. SOME INVESTIGATORS RECOMMEND THAT A BASE PERIOD
EQUAL TO FIVE TIMES THE TIME TO PEAK SHOULD BE TAKEN :
TB = T
OR
T, = 5.455 11
(2.21.5)
ALTERNATIVELY, ASSUMING A TRIANGULAR SHAPE OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH,
T, = 5.556/4P
10. SKETCHING OF UNIT HYDROGRAPHS BECOMES EASIER BY ADOPTING THE FOLLOWING
RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN BY US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, FOR WIDTHS OF
UNIT HYDROGRAPHS AT 50 AND 75% OF THE PENT 11--

WHERE,
W,

= WIDTH OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH IN HOURS, AT 50 % PEAK DISCHARGE.
W75 = WIDTH OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH, IN HOURS, AT 75 % PEAK DISCHARGE.
9P = QP / A = PEAK DISCHARGE PER UNIT AREA.
11. USUALLY, ONE THIRD OF THIS WIDTH IS KEPT BEFORE THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH
PEAK AND TWO THIRDS AFTER THE PEAK.

EXPLAIN THE RATIONAL METHODS OF COMPUTING THE PEAK
ISCHARGE OF A SMALL CATCHMENT. WHERE THIS METHOD IS COMMONLY
SED AND WHAT ARE ITS MERITS AND DEMERITS ? ALSO DISCUSS THE RUNOFF
O-EFFICIENT C OF THE RATIONAL FORMULA.
10
ANSWER
RATIONAL METHODS :
AMONGST VARIOUS TYPES OF EMPIRICAL RELATIONS, RATIONAL FORMULA IS THE
MOST RATIONAL METHOD OF CALCULATING PEAK DISCHARGE FOR SMALL
CATCHMENTS.
IN THIS METHOD, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MAXIMUM FLOOD FLOW IS PRODUCED
BY A CERTAIN RAINFALL INTENSITY WHICH LASTS FOR A TIME EQUAL TO OR GREATER
THAN THE PERIOD OF CONCENTRATION TIME (TD)
THE MAXIMUM RATE OF RUNOFF FROM THE WATERSHED APPEARS WHEN THE
ENTIRE AREA CONTRIBUTES AT THE BASIN OUTLET.
THE RUNOFF GRADUALLY INCREASES FROM ZERO TO PEAK WHEN THE RAINFALL
DURATION REACHES THE TIME OF CONCENTRATION (T). IF THE RAINFALL CONTINUES
BEYOND TOR THE RUNOFF WILL BE CONSTANT AND AT THE PEAK VALUE.
THE PEAK VALUE OF RUNOFF IS GIVEN BY,
QP = FU CIA
WHERE,
C = RUNOFF CO-EFFICIENT REPRESENTING A RATIO OF RUNOFF TO
RAINFALL.
A = CATCHMENT AREA IN KM�.
I = RAINFALL INTENSITY IN CM/HOUR.
FR U = A FACTOR WHICH PERMITS THE EXPRESSION OF TERMS QP A AND I

DESCRIBE THE TERM DERIGN STORM. HOW IS IT DETERMINED?
ANEWER
DERIGN STORM :
1
TO ENTIMATE THE DESIGN BAXT FOR A PROJECT BY THE USE OF A UNIT HYDROGRAGK,
ONE NEEDS THE DERIGN STORM.
2. THIS CAN BE THE STORM-PRODUCING PROBABLE MAZIMUM PRECIPITATION
(PMP) FOR DERIVING PMF OR A STANDARD PROJECT STORM (SPS) FOR
CALCULATIONS.
3. THE COMPUTATIONS ARE PERFORMED BY EXPERIENCED
BY USING METEOROLOGICAL DATA VARIOUS METHODS RANGING FROM HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED BYDROMETEOROLOGICAL METHODS TO SIMPLE ANALYSIS OF PART
RAINFALL DATA ARE IN USE DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RELIABLE RELEVANT
DATA AND EXPERTISE.
4.
THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF OUTLINE OF A PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN INDIA:
I.
THE DURATION OF THE CRITICAL RAINFALL IS FIRST SELECTED. THIS WILL BE THE OF
BASIN LAG IF THE FLOOD PEAK IS OF INTEREST. IF THE FLOOD VOLUME IS THE
PRIME INTEREST, THE DURATION OF THE LONGEST STORM EXPERIENCED IN
BASIN IS SELECTED.
II
PAST MAJOR STORMS IN THE REGION WHICH CONCEIVABLY COULD HAVE OCCURRED
IN THE BASIN UNDER STUDY ARE SELECTED. DAD ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED
AND THE ENVELOPING CURVE REPRESENTING MAXIMUM DEPTH-DURATION
RELATION FOR THE STUDY BASIN OBTAINED.
III.
RAINFALL DEPTHS FOR CONVENIENT TIME INTERVALS (E.G., 6 H) ARE SCALED TO
GET A CRITICAL SEQUENCE WHICH PRODUCES THE MAXIMUM FLOOD PEAK
FROM THE ENVELOPING CURVE. THESE INCREMENTS ARE TO BE ARRANGED
WHEN APPLIED TO THE RELEVANT UNIT HYDROGRAPH OF THE BASIN.
IV.
THE CRITICAL SEQUENCE OF RAINFALL INCREMENTS CAN BE
AND ERROR. ALTERNATIVELY, INCREMENTS OF PRECIPITATION ARE
IN A TABLE OF RELEVANT UNIT HYDROGRAPH ORDINATES, SUCH THAT :
A.
THE MAXIMUM RAINFALL INCREMENT IS AGAINST THE MAXIMUM UNIT
HYDROGRAPH ORDINATE.
B.
THE SECOND HIGHEST RAINFALL INCREMENT IS AGAINST THE SECOND LARGEST
UNIT HYDROGRAPH ORDINATE, AND SO ON.
C.
THE SEQUENCE OF RAINFALL INCREMENTS ARRANGED ABOVE IS NOW
REVERSED, WITH THE LAST ITEM FIRST AND FIRST ITEM LAST. THE NEW
SEQUENCE GIVES THE DESIGN STORM.
V.
THE DESIGN STORM IS THEN COMBINED WITH HYDROLOGIC ABSTRACTIONS MOST
CONDUCTIVE TO HIGH RUNOFF, VIZ., LOW INITIAL LOSS AND LOWEST INFILTRATION
RATE TO GET THE HYETOGRAPH OF RAINFALL EXCESS TO OPERATE UPON THE UNIT
HYDROGRAPH.

ANSWER
IN
RISK AND RELIABILITY =
2
THE DERIGNER OF 2 HYDRAULIC STRUCTURE ALWAYS FEES Z NAGGING DONST
ABOUT THE RISK OF FAILURE OF HIS STRUCTURE.
2
THIS IS BECAUSE THE ESTIMATION OF THE BYDROLOGIC DERIZE TABLE (STACH
AS THE DESIGN FOOD DISCHARGE AND THE RIVER STAGE DURING THE DESIZE
FLOOD) INVOLVE A NATURAL OR INTRUIT UNCERTAINTY AND 25 SOCH E HYDROLOGICAL
RISK OF FAILURE.
3. THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT (X277) AT LEAST ONCE OVER
A PERIOD OF N SUCCESSIVE YEARS IS CALLED THE RISK, P. THUS, THE RISK IS
GIVEN BY,
R = 1 (PROBABILITY OF OF THE EVENT = 227 IN N YEERS)
R = 1 (1
WHERE, P = PROBABILITY P(ZZIN= T =RETURN PERIOD.
4.
THE RELIABILITY R. IS DEFINEDAS
R,=1-R=(2-4) = 1 R =
5. IT CAN BE SEEN THAT THE RETURN PERIOD FOR WHICH A STRUCTURE SHOULD BE
DESIGNED DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK. IN PRACTICE, THE
ACCEPTABLE RISK IS GOVERNED BY ECONOMIC AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.
B. SAFETY FACTOR :
1.
IN ADDITION TO THE HYDROLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, A
WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WILL HAVE MANY OTHER UNCERTAINTIES.
2.
THESE MAY ARISE OUT OF STRUCTURAL, CONSTRUCTIONAL. OPERATIONAL AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES AS WELL AS FROM NON-TECHNOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
SUCH AS ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL CAUSES.
3.
AS SUCH, ANY WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WILL HAVE A SAFETY
FACTOR FOR A GIVEN HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETER M AS DEFINED BELOW.

QUE 3.13.
DEFINE FLOOD ROUTING. DISCUSS BROAD CATEGORIES OF ROUTING.
ANSWER
FLOOD ROUTING : IT IS THE TECHNIQUE OF DETERMINING THE FLOOD HYDROGRAPH
AT A SECTION OF A RIVER BY UTILIZING THE DATA OF FLOOD FLOW AT ONE OR MORE
UPSTREAM SECTIONS.
IN THESE APPLICATIONS TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF ROUTING CAN BE RECOGNIZED.
THOSE ARE :
1.
RESERVOIR ROUTING :
I.
IN RESORVOIR ROUTING THE EFFECT OF A FLOOD WAVE ENTERING A RESERVOIR IS
STUDIED.

BEGINNING
OF A TIME STEP A. HENCE THE VALUE OF THE FUNCTION (S, + QAI
AT THE END OF THE TIME STEP IS CALCULATED BY EQUATION (3.15.1).
IV. SINCE THE RELATION S = S(H) AND Q = Q(H) ARE KNOWN, + 2 WILL
ENABLE ONE TO DETERMINE THE RESERVOIR ELEVATION AND HENCE
THE
DISCHARGE AT THE END OF THE TIME STEP. THE PROCEDURE IS REPEATED TO
COVER THE FULL INFLOW HYDROGRAPH.
V.
FOR PRACTICAL USE IN HAND COMPUTATION, THE FOLLOWING SEMI-GRAPHICAL
METHOD IS VERY CONVENIENT :
A
FROM THE KNOWN STORAGE-ELEVATION AND DISCHARGE-ELEVATION DATA,
PREPARE A CURVE OF (S + 2 ELEVATION. HERE, ANY
VS. AT IS CHOSEN

ATTENUATION :
1.
OWING TO THE STORAGE EFFECT, THE PEAK OF THE OUTFLOW HYDROGRAPH WIL
BE SMALLER THAN THAT OF THE INFLOW HYDROGRAPH. THIS REDUCTION IN THE
PEAK VALUE LS CALLED ATTENUSTION
2
FURTBER THE PESK OF THE OUTFLOW OCCURS AFTER THE PEAK OF THE INFLOW,
THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PEAKS IS KNOWN AS LAG.

ANSWER
HYDROLOGIE CHANNEL ROUTING :
1 IN RESERVOIR ROUTING, THE STORAGE WAS A UNIQUE FUNCTION OF THE OUTFLOW B
DISCHARGE, S = AQ). HOWEVER, IN CHANNEL ROUTING
FUNCTION OF BOTH OUTFLOW AND INFLOW DISCHARGES AND A
ROUTING METHOD IS NEEDED.

WEDGE STORAGE :
A. IT IS THE WEDGE-LIKE VOLUME FORMED BETWEEN THE ACTUAL WATER
SURFACE PROFILE AND THE TOP SURFACE OF THE PRISM STORAGE.
B.
AT A FIXED DEPTH, AT A DOWNSTREAM SECTION OF A RIVER REACH, THE
PRISM STORAGE IS CONSTANT WHILE THE WEDGE STORAGE CHANGES FROM
A POSITIVE VALUE AT AN ADVANCING FLOOD TO A NEGATIVE VALUE DURING
A RECEDING FLOOD.
C.
THE PRISM STORAGE SP IS SIMILAR TO A RESERVOIR AND CAN BE EXPRESSED
AS A FUNCTION OF THE OUTFLOW DISCHARGE, SP = F(Q).
D.
THE WEDGE STORAGE CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY EXPRESSING IT AS
SU = /\I).
E.
THE TOTAL STORAGE IN THE CHANNEL REACH CAN THEN BE EXPRESSED AS,
S = K
(3.17.1)
WHERE, K AND X ARE COEFFICIENTS AND M = A CONSTANT EXPONENT.
F.
IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE VALUE OF M VARIES FROM 0.6 FOR RECTANGULAR
CHANNELS TO A VALUE OF ABOUT 1.0 FOR NATURAL CHANNELS.
MUSKINGUM EQUATION :
USING M - 1.0, EQ. (3.17.1) REDUCES TO A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP FOR S IN
TERMS OF I AND Q AS,

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
3-21 C (CE-SEM-B)
S = K [X I + (1 - X) Q1
AND THIS RELATIONSHIP IS KNOWN AS THE MUSKINGUM EQUATION.
(3.17.2)
2.
IN THIS THE PARAMETER X IS KNOWN AS WEIGHTING FACTOR AND TAKES
VALUE BETWEEN O AND 0.5.
A
3.
WHEN X = 0, OBVIOUSLY THE STORAGE IS A FUNCTION OF DISCHARGE ONLY AND
EQ. (3.17.2) REDUCES TO
S = KQ
(3.17.3)
SUCH STORAGE IS KNOWN AS LINEAR STORAGE OR LINEAR RESERVOIR.
4.
WHEN X = 0.5, BOTH THE INFLOW AND OUTFLOW ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN
DETERMINING THE STORAGE.
5.
THE COEFFICIENT K IS KNOWN AS STORAGE-TIME CONSTANT AND HAS THE
DIMENSIONS OF TIME.
PROCEDURE :

OR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FLOOD CONTROL ? EXPLAIN ANY TWO METHODS OF
FLOOD CONTROL AND ALSO MENTION ANY TWO EMPIRICAL FORMULATE FOR

ANSWER
A.
FLOOD CONTROL: THE TERM FLOOD CONTROL IS COMMONLY USED TO DENOTE ALL
THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO REDUCE DAMAGES TO LIFE AND PROPERTY BY FLOODS.
STRUCTURAL METHODS : FOLLOWING ARE THE STRUCTURAL METHOD
:
1.
STORAGE RESERVOIR :
I.
STORAGE RESERVOIRS OFFER ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE METHODS
OF FLOOD CONTROL,
II.
IDEALLY, IN THIS METHOD, A PART OF THE STORAGE IN THE RESERVOIR IS KEPT
APART TO ABSORB THE INCOMING FLOOD.
III. FURTHER, THE STORED WATER IS RELEASED IN A CONTROLLED WAY OVER AN
EXTENDED TIME NO THAT DOWNSTREAM CHANNELS DO NOT GET FLOODED.
IV. FIGURE. 3.18.1 SHOWS UN IDEAL OPERATING PLAN OF A FLOOD CONTROL RESERVOIR.

2 LEVEES :
I.
LEVEES, ALSO KNOWN AS DIKES OR FLOOD EMBANKMENTS ARE EARTHEN
BANKS CONSTRUCTED PARALLEL TO THE COURSE OF THE RIVER TO CONFINE IT TO A
FIXED COURSE AND LIMITED CROSS-SECTIONAL WIDTH.
II.
MASONRY STRUCTURES USED TO CONFINE THE RIVER IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO
LEVEES ARE KNOWN AS FLOOD WALLS. THESE ARE USED TO PROTECT IMPORTANT
STRUCTURES AGAINST FLOODS, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE LAND IS AT A PREMIUM.
III. THE HEIGHTS OF LEVEES WILL BE HIGHER THAN THE DESIGN FLOOD LEVEL WITH
SUFFICIENT FREE BOARD.
IV. THE CONFINEMENT OF THE RIVER TO A FIXED PATH FREES LARGE TRACTS OF LAND
FROM INUNDATION AND CONSEQUENT DAMAGE.
V.
LEVEES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST COMMON METHODS OF FLOOD-
PROTECTION WORKS ADOPTED IN THE WORLD. ALSO, THEY ARE PROBABLY THE
CHEAPEST OF STRUCTURAL FLOOD-CONTROL MEASURES.
VI.
WHILE THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY A LEVEE AGAINST FLOOD DAMAGE IS OBVIOUS,
WHAT IS NOT OFTEN APPRECIATED IS THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE IN THE EVENT OF
A LEVEE FAILURE.
VII. THE DESIGN OF A LEVEE IS A MAJOR TASK IN WHICH COSTS AND ECONOMIC
BENEFITS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.
VIII. THE CROSS-SECTION OF A LEVEE WILL HAVE TO BE DESIGNED LIKE AN EARTH
DAM FOR COMPLETE SAFETY AGAINST ALL KINDS OF SATURATION AND DRAWDOWN
POSSIBILITIES.
3. FLOODWAYS :
I.
FLOODWAYS ARE NATURAL CHANNELS INTO WHICH A PART OF THE FLOOD WILL BE
DIVERTED DURING HIGH STAGES.
II.
A FLOODWAY CAN BE A NATURAL OR MANMADE CHANNEL AND ITS LOCATION IS
CONTROLLED ESSENTIALLY BY THE TOPOGRAPHY.
III.
GENERALLY, WHEREVER THEY ARE FEASIBLE, FLOODWAYS OFFER AN ECONOMICAL
ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER STRUCTURAL FLOOD-CONTROL MENSURES.

WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AND LAND TREATMENT IN THE CATCHMENT AIMS
AT CUTTING DOWN AND DELAYING THE RUNOFF BEFORE IT GETS INTO THE RIVER.
IS
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT MEASURES INCLUDE DEVELOPING THE VEGETATIVE
AND SOIL COVER IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAND TREATMENT WORDS LIKE NALABUNDS,
CHECK DAMS, CONTOUR BUNDING. ZING TERRACES ETC.

IT IS BELIEVED THAT WHILE SMALL AND MEDIUM FLOODS ARE REDUCED BY
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT MEASURES, THE MAGNITUDE OF EXTREME FLOODS
ARE UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THESE MEASURES.

FLOOD CONTROL IN INDIA :
I.
IN INDIA, THE HIMALAYAN RIVERS ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 60 % OF THE FLOOD
DAMAGE IN THE COUNTRY.

1-240
. NAUSAY
II
FLOODS IN THESE RIVERN OCCUR DURING MONACON MONTHS AND USUALLY IN THE
MONTHS OF AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER. THE DAMAGEA CAUMED BY FLONDA ARE
DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE.
III.
DURING 1953-2004, THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HUMAN LIVEN AND CATTLE LOST
DUE TO FLOODS IN THE COUNTRY WERE 1597 AND 94,000 RESPECTIVELY
IV. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ANNUALLY, ON AN AVERAGE ABOUT 40 MHA OF LAND IN
LIABLE TO FLOODING AND OF THIS ABOUT 14 MHA HAVE SOME KIND OF FLOOD
CONTROL MEASURES.
V.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT MILLENNIUM, IN THE COUNTRY, AS PER FINOD
CONTROL MEASURES, THERE WERE ABOUT 15800 KM OF LEVEES AND ABOUT 32000
KM OF DRAINAGE CHANNEL AFFORDING PROTECTION FROM FLOODS.
VI. ON AN AVERAGE, ABOUT. 7.5 MHA LAND IS AFFECTED BY FLOOD ANNUALLY. OUT OF
THIS, ABOUT 3.56 MHA ARE LANDA UNDER CROPS.
VII.
SIMILARLY, ANNUALLY ABOUT 3.345 LAKHS PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED AND ABOUT
12.15 LAKHS HOUSES ARE DAMAGED BY FLOOD. ON AN AVERAGE. ABOUT 60-80 %
OF FLOOD DAMAGES OCCUR IN THE STATE U.P., BIHAR, WEST BENGAL. ASSAM AND
ODISHA.
VIII. FLOOD FORECASTING IS HANDLED BY CWC. THE CWC HAS 157 FLOOD FORECASTING
STATIONS, OF WHICH 132 STATIONS ARE FOR RIVER STAGE FORECAST AND 25 FOR
INFLOW FORECAST.
IX. A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT WAS LAUNCHED IN 1954 AND
AN AMOUNT OF 3165 CRORES WAS SPENT TILL 1992. THE TENTH PLAN
(2002-2007) HAD AN EXPENDITURE OF 4468 CRORES FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT.
QUE 3.20.
WHAT IS MEANT BY THE TERM FLOOD FORECASTING AND
WARNING? DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS FLOOD FORECASTING TECHNIQUES.
ANSWER
A.
FLOOD FORECASTING AND WARNING :
1.
FORECASTING OF FLOODS SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE ENABLES A WARNING TO BE
GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AND FURTHER ENABLES CIVIL
AUTHORITIES TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.
2.
IT THUS FORMS A VERY IMPORTANT AND RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE NON-STRUCTURAL
FLOOD MANAGEMENT MEASURE.
3.
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE REALIZED THAT A FLOOD WARNING IS MEANINGFUL ONLY
IF IT IS GIVEN SUFFICIONTLY IN ADVANCE.
4.
FURTHER, ERRONEOUS WARNINGS WILL CAUSE THE POPULACE TO LOSE CONFIDENCE
AND FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. THUS THE DUAL REQUIREMENTS OF RELIABILITY AND
ADVANCE NOTICE ARE THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF A FLOOD FORECASTING
SYSTEM.
FLOOD FORECASTING TECHNIQUES : THE FLOOD FORECASTING TECHNIQUES
CAN BE BROADLY DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORIES :

ENGR HYDRALOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
3-25 C (CE-SEM-8)
1.
SHORT-RANGE FORECASTS :
I
IN THIS THE RIVER STAGES AT SUCCESSIVE STATIONS ON A RIVER ARE CORRELATED
WITH HYCROLOGICAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS RAINFALL OVER THE LOCAL AREA,
ANTENEDENT PRECIPITATION INDER, AND VARIATION OF THE STAGE AT THE
UNSTREAM BASE POINT DURING THE TRAVEL TIME OF A FLOOD.
E
THIS METHOD CAN GIVE ADVANCE WARNING OF 12-40 HOURS FOR FLOODS. THE
BOOD FIRRECASTING USED FOR THE METROPOLITAN CITY OF DELHI IS BASED ON
THIS TECHNIQUE.
=
MEDIUM RENGE FORECASTS :
NECIOD RAINFALL-RUNOFF RELATIONSHIPS ARE USED TO PREDICT FLOOD
LEVELS WITH WARNING OF 2-5 DAYS.
E
GRAPHICAL CORRELATIONS OF RUNOFF, WITH RAINFALL AND OTHER
SHE THE TIME OF THE YEAR. STORM DURATION AND ANTECEDENT

WRITE DOWN IN DETAILS SELECTION OF SUITABLE SITE FOR A TUBE
WELL.
ANSWER
SELECTION OF THE SUITABLE SITE : THE FOLLOWING POINTS SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SITE :
1.
TUBE WELL SHOULD BE SELECTED AT A SITE WHERE LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR
EXISTS.
2. IF THE GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS INDICATE RIDGES AND DEPRESSIONS OF
IMPERMEABLE STRATA INSIDE THE GROUND, THE TUBE WELL SHOULD BE LOCATED
WHERE THERE IS THE VALLEY.
3.
THE AREA SHOULD HAVE AN ACCESS FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF A CHEAP ELECTRIC
SUPPLY SO THAT MOTOR DRIVEN PUMPS CAN BE FITTED WITH TUBE WELLS WITHOUT
AN EXORBITANT COST.
4.
THE AREA SHOULD HAVE A WELL DISTRIBUTED AND UNIFORM DEMAND FOR
IRRIGATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IF THE DEMAND IS NOT UNIFORM. TUBE WELL
WILL BE IDLING FOR SOME TIME OR HAS TO WORK INEFFICIENTLY AND THUS THE COST
FOR OVERALL IRRIGATION WILL INCREASE.
5.
THE AREA AROUND THE TUBE WELL SHOULD HAVE AN INTENSIVE CULTIVATION AND
THE TUBE WELL SHOULD BE LOCATED CENTRALLY SO AS TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF
GULF AND THEREBY TRANSIENT LOSSES.
6.
THE WATER AVAILABLE FROM THE TUBE WELL SHOULD BE TESTED TO FIND OUT THE
IRRIGATION QUALITY OF WATER. IF THE WATER IS FOUND TO HAVE HARMFUL SALTS,
THE SITE MAY HAVE TO BE CHANGED IN SPITE OF VARIOUS ADVANTAGES.

ANSWER
1.
WHEN A WELL IN A CONFINED AQUIFER STARTS DISCHARGING. THE WATER FROM
THE AQUIFER IS RELEASED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A CONE OF DEPRESSION
OF THE PIEZOMETRIC SURFACE. THIS CONE GRADUALLY EXPANDS WITH TIME TILL

WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY CAVITY FORMATION IN OPEN
WELL ?
ANSWER
CAVITY FORMATION IN OPEN WELL :
1.
CONSIDER A WELL FROM WHICH NO WATER IS BEING WITHDRAWN.
2.
THE WATER LEVEL IN SUCH A WELL WILL OBVIOUSLY BE THE SAME AS IS THE STATIE
WATERTABLE OUTSIDE THE WELL.
3.
NOW, IF A DISCHARGE IS WITHDRAWN FROM THIS WELL AT A CONSTANT RATE, THE
LEVEL IN THE WELL WILL GO DOWN AND STABILIZE AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF
THE OUTSIDE WATERTABLE.
4.
THE HEAD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO LEVELS IS CALLED THE DEPRESSION
HEAD.
5.
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HEAD DIFFERENCE, WATER ENTERS THE WELL, FROM
OUTSIDE, SO AS TO FILL THE GAP CREATED BY THE WITHDRAWAL WATER.
6.
AS THE WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL TRAVELS TOWARDS THE WELL. THERE
IS A GRADUAL LOSS OF HEAD, AND WATER SURFACE DROPS TOWARDS THE WELL.
7.
SINCE THE SAME DISCHARGE IS PASSING THROUGH THE REDUCING SOIL AREAS AS IT
APPROACHES THE WELL, THERE IS A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE FLOW VELOCITY CAN
GRADUALLY INCREASE ONLY FTHE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT GETS GRADUALLY INCREASED.
8.
HENCE, THE WATER SURFACE WILL FALL GENTLY IN THE BEGINNING AND WILL FALL
MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY AS IT APPROACHES THE WELL.
9.
THE SURFACE OF WATER TABLE SURROUNDING THE WELL. THEREFORE, TAKES UP A
CURVED SHAPE AND IS CALLED THE CONE OF DEPRESSION.
10.
AT. A CORTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE WELL IS CALLED THE RADIUS
OF INFLUENCE OF THE WELL.

4-32 C (CE-SEM-8)
GROUNT DER
11. THE VELOCITY OF PERCOLATING WATER INTO THE WELL DEPENDS UPON THE
DEPRESSION HEAD.
12.
IF MORE AMOUNT OF WATER IS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WELL, THEREBY INCREASING
THE DEPRESSION HEAD, HIGHER FLOW VELOCITIES WILL PREVAIL IN THE VICINITY OF
WELL.
13. THUS, AT A CERTAIN RATE OF WITHDRAWAL, IT IS VERY MUCH POSSIBLE THAT THE
FLOW VELOCITY MAY EXCEED THE CRITICAL VELOCITY FOR THE SOIL, THEREBY CAUSING
THE SOIL PARTICLES TO LIFT UP.
14. AS MORE AND MORE SAND PARTICLES ARE LIFTED, A HOLLOW IS CREATED IN THE
BOTTOM OF THE WELL. RESULTING IN THE INCREASED EFFECTIVE AREA, SO THAT
ULTIMATELY. THE VELOCITY FALLS BELOW THE CRITICAL VALUE AND THEN NO FURTHER
SAND GOES OUT OF THE WELL.

3.
AN IMAGE WELL IS A HYPOTHETICAL WELL THAT SIMULATES RECHARGE OR DISCHARGE
AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE HYDRAULIC BOUNDARY AS THE REAL PRODUCTION
WELL. IN OTHER WORDS, THE GEOLOGIE BOUNDARY IS REPLACED BY AN IMAGINARY
WELL FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES.
4.
BOTH THE REAL PRODUCTION WELL AND THE IMAGE WELL ARE CONSIDERED TO BE
OPERATING SIMULTANEOUSLY.
5.
IN THE CASE OF A BARRIER BOUNDARY, THE EFFECT ON DRAWDOWN IN THE
PRODUCTION WELL IS THE SAME AS THROUGH THE AQUIFER WERE OF AN INFINITE
EXTENT AND A DISCHARGE IMAGE WELL WERE LOCATED ACROSS THE BOUNDARY ON
A LINE NORMAL AND THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE BOUNDARY AS THE REAL WELL.

ANSWER
PARTIALLY PENETRATING ARTESIAN WELL :
1.
A PARTIALLY PENETRATING ARTESIAN WELL IS THE ONE IN WHICH THE WELL SCREEN
DOES NOT PENETRATE TO THE FULL DEPTH OF THE CONFINED AQUIFER.
2.
THE PATTERN OF FLOW IN THE AQUIFER IN THE VICINITY OF SUCH A WELL DEVIATES
FROM THAT FOR A FULLY PENETRATING WELL.
3.
IN PRACTICE, WE OFTEN ENCOUNTER SUCH WELLS THAT EXTEND ONLY PART WAY
THROUGH THE WATER BEARING STRATA.

A.
WELL COMPLETION : WELL COMPLETION OPERATIONS INCLUDE:
I.
GROUTING AND SEALING THE CARING.
II.
COMPLETION OF THE TOP OF THE WELL.
III.
DISINFECTION OF THE WELL.
1.
GROUTING THE CASING MEANS FILLING THE ANNULAR SPACE THE
OF THE CASING AND THE INSIDE OF THE DRILLED HOLE WITH A CORRECT PORT
2. THE GROUT IS A FLUID MIXTURE OF CEMENT AND WATER OF A
THAT CAN BE FORCED THROUGH THE GROUT. PIPES AND PLACED AS REQUARED.
3.
GROUTING AND SEALING THE CASING IN WATER WELLA SERVES TO PREVENT THE
DOWNWARD SEEPAGE OF SEWAGE OR OTHER POLLUTED VURFACE WATER THE
OUTSIDE OF THE CASING, TO SEAL OF AQUIFER YIELDING WATER OF YOUR QUASITY, TO
MAKE THE CASING STAY TIGHT IN THE DRILLED BOLE AND IS FORM A PROTECTIVE
SHEATH AROUND THE CASING AGAINST EXTERIOR CORROSION. THEREBY
ITS LIFE.
4.
THE TOP OF THE CASING SHOULD NORMAILY EXTEND AT LEAST 50 C THE
GENERAL LEVEL OF THE SURROUNDING SURFACE, WELL ABOVE THE FOOD
WATER LEVELS AND ISOLATED FROM DIRECT CONTACT WITH ACCUMULATING
WASTES AND SUDDEN DRAINAGE DISCHARGE.
5.
THE SPACE AROUND THE CASING SHOULD BE GROUTED TO A DEPTI OF 6 =
TO SEAL OF THE WELL FROM THE ENTRANCE OF SURFACE DRAINAGE.
6.
A CONCRETE PLATFORM SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AROUND THE CASING AT THE
GROUND SURFACE.
7.
THE TOP OF THE CASING SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH A SANITARY SEAL CONSISTING
OF SUITABLE BUSHING OR PACKING GLANDS THAT MAKES A WATER-
BETWEEN THE PUMP COLUMN PIPE AND THE WELL CASUNG
8.
ABANDONED WELLS SHOULD BE SEALED BY FILLING WITH CIAY OR CEMENT
GROUT TO AVOID POSSIBLE MOVEMENT OF INFERIOR WATER FROM ONE AQUITER TO
ANOTHER AND CONSERVE THE WATER IN PUMPED WEILS.
9.
THIS IS A NECESSARY PRECAUTION EVEN THE WELL CASINGS ARE PERFORATED
ONLY ONE AQUIFER, SINCE EASINGS MAY EVENTUALLY DETERIORATE. GERMITZING

B. WELL DISINFEETION: :
1.
AFTER COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION, THE WELL AND ITS APPURTENATES LIKE
THE CASING, PUMP AND PIPE SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE DISINFECTED OR
PROMPTLY, FOR WHICH CHLORINE SOLUTION IS THE SUMPLESS AND EFFECTIVE
AGENT.
2.
HIGHLY CHLORINATED WATER CAN BE PREPARED BY DEV CALCIUM
HYPOCHLORITE, LIQUID SODIUM HYPOCHLONTE OR GASEVUS WATER
3.
A SOLUTION CONTAINING ABOUT 100 PPM OF AVAILABLE CHLURISE SHOULD BE
USED.

DEVELOPMENT BY SURGING:
I
A SURGE IS FORMED BY THE RECIPROCATING MOVENTED 2 IN
THE
WELL.
IS
THE WATER MOVES ALTERNATELY INTO THE SOIL AND ASMES -
DURING DOWNWARD AND BACKWARD STROKE RESPECTIVELY.
IF
THE APEED OF THE PLUNGER IS SIOWLY INCREASED THE PLUNGER IS OPERATED
THE CASING PIPE PROVIDED ABOVE THE SCREENED PERTICO OF THE WELL
IN
THE REPEATED APPLICATION OF SURGING FORCE DRANS THE FINE PARTICLES

C. RECUPERATION TEST :
1.
THOUGH THE CONSTANT LEVEL PUMPING TEST GIVES AN ACCURATE VALUE OF THE
SAFE VIELD OF AN OPEN WELL. IT IS SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT TO REGULATE THE
PUMP IN SUCH A WAY THAT CONSTANT LEVEL IS MAINTAINED IN THE WELL.
2.
IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE, A RECUPERATION TEST IS RESORTED TO.
3.
IN THE RECUPERATION TEST, WATER LEVEL IS DEPRESSED TO ANY LEVEL BELOW THE
NORMAL AND THE PUMPING IS STOPPED.

5-7C (CE-SEM-8)
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE EQUIPMENTS USED FOR GROUNDWATER:
1.
PLUNGER PUMPS :
I.
HAND PUMPS WITH THE CYLINDER AT THE GROUND SURFACE OR THE HOLLOW BRASS
CYLINDER LOWERED BELOW THE GROUND SURFACE (DEPENDING UPON THE
GROUNDWATER LEVEL) CAN DISCHARGE 20-60 LPM.
II.
A PLUNGER WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE PUMP HANDLE ROD MOVES UP AND
DOWN IN THE CYLINDER. IT CAN BE HAND OPERATED OR DRIVEN BY A 1 OR 2 HP
(V-BELT DRIVEN) MOTOR.
III.
PUMP HANDLES OFTEN GET BROKEN IN CONSTANT VILLAGE USE; HANDLES SHOULD
BE KEPT IN SPARE AS ALSO EXTRA BOLTS, NUT AND BUSHINGS NEEDED AT THE
MOVING JOINT OF THE HANDLE.
IV.
VILLAGERS SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO HANDLE THE PUMPS GENTLY. THE PUMP SHOULD
BE SET SO THAT THE CYLINDER IS WITHIN 6.7-7.6 M OF THE LOWEST WATER TABLE.
AND CAN PUMP OF A TOTAL HEAD OF 45-60 M.
2.
JET PUMPS :
I.
JET PUMPS ARE OFTEN PRACTICABLE FOR PUMPING RATHER SMALL FLOWS
(40-90 LPM) UNDER LOW HEADS (15-45 M) WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IS BEYOND
7.6 M FROM THE GROUND SURFACE. THEIR CAPACITY REDUCES AS THE LIFT
INCREASES.
II.
AJET PUMP CONSISTS OF A PUMP AND A JET.
III.
WATER IS RECIRCULATED FROM THE DELIVERY SIDE OF THE PUMP TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE SUCTION PIPE AND IS INJECTED THROUGH A NOZZLE TO IMPART ADDITIONAL
KINETIC ENERGY.
IV.
THIS GIVES ADDITIONAL SUCTION LIFT BY CREATING A PARTIAL VACUUM AT THIS
POINT.
V.
THE ADVANTAGE OF THE JET PUMP OVER MOST OTHER TYPES OF DEEP-WELL PUMPS
IS THAT THE PUMP AND MOTOR MAY BE SET AWAY FROM THE WELL.
VI.
JET PUMPS ARE USUALLY USED FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND HOTELS.
VII. THESE ARE OF TWO TYPES : TWIN TYPE FOR BORE WELLS 15 EM AND ABOVE, AND
PACKER TYPE (DUPLEX) FOR BORE WELLS LESS THAN 15 EM.
3.
DEEP WELL VERTICAL TURBINE PUMPS :
I.
DEEP-WELL VERTICAL TURBINE PUMPS ARE MOST WIDELY USED FOR LARGE TUBE
WELLS.
II.
THE BOWL-ASSEMBLY (IMPELLERS) IS KEPT BELOW THE LOWEST PUMPING WATER
LEVEL, BUT THE DRIVING UNIT-ELECTRIC MOTOR OR PETROL OR DIESEL ENGINE-IS ON
THE GROUND SURFACE AND IS CONNECTED BY A LONG SHAFT.
III.
USUALLY DEEP-WELL TURBINE PUMPS ARE USED FOR TAIR(Y HIGH FLOWS UNDER
HIGH HEADS. THIS TYPE OF PUMP HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF HIGH EFFICIENEY.
HIGH HEAD PUMPING CAPABILITY AND EXCELLENT SERVICEABILITY.

5-SC (CE-SEM-S)
GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND MODALS
IV. THE IMPELLERS CAN BE OBTAINED SEMI OPEN OR FULLY ENCLOSED. THIS PUMP
REQUIRES SUFFICIENTLY STRAIGHT AND PLUMB WELL FOR INSTALLATION AND PROPER
OPERATION AND IS SUBJECT TO ABRASION FROM SAND.
5.
THE MAINTENANCE PROBLEM IS SEVERE WHEN PUMPING CORROSIVE WATER
UNLESS PUMP. COLUMN. SHAFT ETC., ARE MADE OF NON-CORROSIVE MATERIALS.
LUBRICATION AND VERTICAL ALIGNMENT OF SHAFT IS CRITICAL. THE OVERALL
EFFICIENCIES OF TURBINE PUMPS RANGE FROM 50 TO SO %.
4
SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS:
I
SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS HAVE THE MOTOR AND THE BOWL ASSEMBLY AS A UNIT
SUBMERGED BELOW THE LOWEST PUMPING WATER LEVEL.
E
A WATER PROOF CABLE SUPPLIES POWER TO MOTOR.
E SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS TO FIT INSIDE 10. 15, 20 AND 25 CM BOREWELLS ARE
AVAILABLE IN INDIA.
IN THEY CAN BE USED FOR LOW RATES FROM 40-3000 LPM AND HEADS FROM
15-150 =
T.
THEY CAN BE INSTALLED IN CROOKED WELLS BUT REPAIR TO MOTOR OR PUMP
REQUIRES REMOVAL FROM WELL IS SUBJECT TO ABRASION FROM SAND.
-2 THIS TYPE OF PUMP HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT CAN BE INSTALLED WHEN THERE
IS LITTLE OF DO FLOOR SPACE TO INSTALL THE UNIT AND IN LOCATIONS THAT REQUIRE
QUIET OPERATION.
EE
THEY CAN BE EITHER WATER OR OIL LUBRICATED
THE THEIR INITIAL COSTS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE OF VERTICAL TURBINE PUMPS. THEIR
REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. HOWEVER, ARE HIGH.
IN THE NEW TYPE OF VOLTAGE REGULATED STARTERS HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF
OVER LOADING
5. AIR-LIFT PUMPS:
I
AIR-LIFT PUMPS HAVE EFFICIENCIES RANGING FROM 20 TO 35%; THE EFFICIENCY
GREETHY DEPARDS UPON THE PERCENTAGE SUBMERGENCE AND IS REASONABLE
WHEN THE PERCENTAGE SUBMERGENCE IS 50 TO 60%.
IL
THEY PROUPS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING NO MOVING PARTS BELOW THE
GOUND LEVEL
IL

WELL MAIMTEMANCE :
1.
WHILE THE EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE OF A WELL DEPENDS UPON THE DESIGN.
CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE WELL. PROPER MAINTENANCE
HELPS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND INCREASE THE LIFE OF THE WELL.
2.
PROPER RECORDS OF POWER CONSUMPTION. WELL DISCHARGE, DRAWDOWN,
OPERATING HOURS, PERIODICAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER AND. OTHER FACH
OBSERVATIONS WILL HELP IN DEVISING PROPER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES.
3.
THE SUDDEN PRESSURE DROP AND INCREASE IN THE ENTRANCE VELOCITY NEAR
THE SCREEN DUE TO HIGH PUMPING RATES RELEASES CARBON DIOXIDE AND
CAUSES PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM CARBONATE AND IRON DEPOSITS NEAR THE
SCREEN.
4.
THE CHANGE IN ENTRANCE VELOCITIES RESULTS IN PRECIPITATION OF IRON AND
MANGANESE HYDROXIDES.
5.
THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN IN THE WELL CAN CHANGE SOLUBLE FERROUS IRON TO
INSOLUBLE FERRIC HYDROXIDE. THE PERFORATIONS CAN BE CLEANED BY ADDING
HYDROCHLORIC (MURIATIC) ACID OR CALGON FOLLOWED BY AGITATION AND SURGING
WHICH REMOVES THE INCRUSTING DEPOSITS.
6.
NORMALLY, THE VOLUME OF ACID REQUIRED FOR A SINGLE TREATMENT WILL BE
ABOUT 1.5 TO 2 TIMES THE VOLUME OF WATER IN THE SCREEN.
7.
SULFURIC ACID CAN ALSO BE USED INSTEAD OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID BUT ITS
ACTION IS A LITTLE SLOWER AND REQUIRES A LONGER CONTACT TIME IN THE WELL.
S.
THE YIELD OF THE WELL MAY DECREASE DUE TO THE DEPOSITION OF INCRUSTATION
OF FINE PARTICLES OF SILT AND CLAY NEAR THE SCREEN. THIS CAN BE REMOVED
BY THE USE OF A DISPERSING AGENT SUCH AS POLYPHOSPHATES. FOR EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT, 15 TO 30 KG OF POLYPHOSPHATE IS ADDED TO EVERY 1000 LITRES OF
WATER IN THE WELL.
9.
1 KG OF CALCIUM HYPOCHLORITE SHOULD BE ADDED FOR EVERY 1000 LITRES OF
WATER IN THE WELL TO FACILITATE THE REMOVAL OF IRON BACTERIA AND THEIR
SLIMES, AND ALSO FOR DISINFECTION PURPOSES.
10. THE SOLUTION OF POLYPHOSPHATE AND HYPOCHLORITE IS POURED INTO THE WELL
AND A SURGE PLUNGER OR THE JETTING TECHNIQUE IS USED TO AGITATE THE
WATER THE WELL MAY BE TREATED 2-3 TIMES FOR BETTER RESULTS
11. THE PERFORATIONS MAY BECOME PLUGGED WITH ALGAE OR BACTERIAL GROWTHS

10
ANSWER
THE PROTECTION OF WATER WELLS CAN BE CONSISTS OF :
1 SANITARY PROTECTION:
I
WHEREVER GROUNDWATER PUMPED FROM A WELL IS INTENDED FOR HUMAN
CONSUMPTION. PROPER SANITARY PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN TO PROTECT
THE WATER QUALITY POLLUTION SOURCES MAY EXIST EITHER ABOVE OR BELOVE
GROUND SURFACE.
IL
SURFACE POLLUTION CAN ENTER WELLS EITHER THROUGH THE ANNULAR SPACE
OUTSIDE OF THE CASING OR THROUGH THE TOP OF THE WELL ITSELF.
IL
TO CLOSE AVENUES OF ACCESS FOR UNDESIRABLE WATER OUTSIDE OF THE CASING,
THE ANNULAR SPACE SHOULD BE FILLED WITH CEMENT GROUT FOR DEEP WELLS.
IN. ENTRY THROUGH THE TOP OF THE WELL CAN BE AVOIDED BY PROVIDING A
WATERTIGHT COVER TO SEAL THE TOP OF THE CASING.
T. SOME PUMPE ARE AVAILABLE WITH CLOSED METAL BASES THAT PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY CLOSURE.
VI FOR PUMPS HAVING AN OPEN-TYPE BASE, OR WHERE THE PUMP IS NOT PLACED
DIRECTLY OVER THE WELL. A SEAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE ANNULAR OPENING BETWEEN
THE DISCHARGE PIPE AND CASING.
VEL SEALS MAY BE MADE OF METAL OR LEAD PACKING, ASPHALTIC AND MASTIC
COMPOUNDS ARE ALSO SATISFACTORY.
VIII. COVERS AROUND THE WELL SHOULD BE MADE OF CONCRETE, SHOULD BE ELEVATED
ABOVE THE ADJACENT LAND LEVEL, AND SHOULD SLOPE AWAY FROM THE WELL.
2
FROST PROTECTION :
I
IN REGIONS WHERE WINTER FROST OCCURS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PUMPS
AND WATER LINES FROM FREEZING.
IL
PROVIDE PITLESS ADOPTER FOR FROSTPROOFING A DOMESTIC WELL.
THE PITLESS ADAPTER, ATTACHED TO THE WELL CASING, PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE
WELL, WHILE THE DISCHARGE PIPE RUNS ABOUT 2 M UNDERGROUND BASEMENT

ANSWER
A CONTAMINATION OF GROUNDWATER :
1
GROUNDWATER IS MORE PROTECTED THAN SURFACE WATER, BUT IT CAN BE
CONTAMINATED FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.
2 WATER DISSOLVES MORE THINGS THAN ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE, IT IS VERY
SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTAMINATION OR POLLUTION.
3. CONTAMINATION IS A MODIFICATION OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL
PROPERTIES OF GROUNDWATER. RESTRICTING OR PREVENTING ITS USE FOR VARIOUS
PURPOSES.
4.
IT CAN IMPAIR THE USE OF WATER AND CAN CREATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH
THROUGH TOXICITY OR THE SPREAD OF DISEASE.
5. GENERALLY, CONTAMINATION AND POLLUTION TERMS ARE USED AS SYNONYMOUS
IN GROUNDWATER.
6.
THE POSSIBLE POLLUTANTS IN GROUNDWATER ARE MANY. THEY COULD BE FROM
GEOGENIC SOURCES OR ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES.
7.
CONTAMINATION FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF AQUIFER MATERIAL IS GEOGENIC.
FLUORIDE. ARSENIC. IRON, AND OTHER HEAVY METALS IN GROUNDWATER ARE
USUALLY DUE TO GEOGENIC SOURCE CONTAMINATION.
8.
ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES AND CAUSES OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN INTERVENTIONS AND USE OF WATER.
9.
MOST POLLUTION STEMS FROM DISPOSAL OF WASTES ON OR INTO THE GROUND.
10. THE PRINCIPAL ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES AND CAUSES (CONTINUOUS AND/OR

DESCRIBE FLUORIDE REMOVAL TECHNIQUES.
OS
ANSWER
REMOVAL TECHNIQUES : FOLLOWING ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES GENERALLY
USED FOR REMOVING FLUORIDES FROM WATER :
1.
ABSORPTION BY ACTIVATED ALUMINA (AA), COMMONLY KNOWN AS PRASHANTI
TECHNOLOGY.
2.
NALGONDA TECHNIQUE.
3.
ION EXCHANGE ADSORPTION METHOD.
4.
REVERSE OSMOSIS PROCESS.
1.
PRASHANTI TECHNIQUE USING ADSORPTION BY ACTIVATED ALUMINA
(AA) : IN THIS METHODS, THE RAW WATER CONTAINING HIGH CONTENTS OF
FLUORIDE, IS PASSED (PERCOLATED) THROUGH THE INSOLUBLE GRANULAR BEDS OF
SUBSTANCE LIKE ACTIVATED ALUMINA (AA), OR BONE CHAR. OR ACTIVATED
CARBON, OR SERPENTINITE, OR ACTIVATED BAUXITE : WHICH ADSORBS FLUORIDE
FROM THE PERCOLATING WATER, GIVING OUT DEFLUORIDATED WATER.
2
NALGONDA TECHNIQUE :
I.
NALGONDA TECHNIQUE USES ALUMINIUM SALT (ALUM) FOR REMOVING FLUORIDE.
II.
THE RAW WATER IS FIRSTLY MIXED WITH ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF LIME (CAO) OR
SODIUM CARBONATE (NA,CO2) AND THOROUGHLY MIXED.
III.
ALUM SOLUTION IS THEN ADDED, AND WATER IS STIRRED SLOWLY FOR ABOUT 10
MINUTES, AND ALLOWED TO SETTLE FOR NEARLY ONE HOUR.
IV.
THE PRECIPITATED SLUDGE IS DISCARDED, AND THE CLEAR SUPERNATANT CONTAINING
PERMISSIBLE AMOUNT OF FLUORIDE IS WITHDRAWN FOR USE.
V.
THE LINE DIAGRAM FOR THE PROCESS IS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 5.9.1.
VI. THE ADDED LIME OR SODIUM CARBONATE HELPS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE ALKALINITY
REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE HYDROLYSIS OF ALUMINIUM SALTS, SO THAT THE RESIDUAL
ALUMINIUM DOES NOT REMAIN IN THE TREATED WATER.
VII. BLEACHING POWDER IS ALSO GENERALLY ADDED WITH LIME PRIOR TO THE ADDITION
OF ALUM, TO ACHIEVE SIMULTANEOUS DISINFECTION OF TREATED WATER, AND
ALSO TO KEEP THE SYSTEM FREE FROM UNDESIRABLE BIOLOGICAL GROWTH.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SALTWATER INTRASION IM COASTAL
AQUIFER ? WHAT IS THE METHOD OF LOCATE IT ? EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS
METHODS TO LIMIT SALTWATER INTRASION
2018-19. 10
ANSWER
A SALTWATER INTRUSION =
1 SALTWATER INTRUSION IS THE MOVEMENT OF SALINE WATER INCO FRESH WATER
AQUIFERS. WHICH CAN LEAD TO CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER SOURCES
AND OTHER CONSEQUENCES.
2
SALTWATER INTRUSION OCCURS NATURALLY TO SOME DEGREE IN MOST COASTAL
AQUIFERS, OWING TO THE HYDRAULIC CONNECTION BETWREEN GROUNDWATER AND
SEAWATER.
3 BECAUSE SALINE WATER HAS A HIGHER MINERAL CONTENT THEN FRESI WATER. IT
IS DENSER AND HAS A HIGHER WATER PRESSURE. AS S RESULT SALWATER CAN
PUSH INLAND BENEATH THE FRESHWATER.
B. METHOD OF LOCATION OF INTRUSION IN COASTAL AQUIFER: :
1.
ANALYSIS OF GROUNDWATER SAMPLES COLLECTED IN ZOGES OF SEAWATER INTRASION
MAY SHOW A CHEMICAL COMPOSITION DIFFERING FROM A SIMPLE PROPORTIONAL
MIXING OF SEAWATER AND GROUNDWATER.
2
MODIFICATIONS IN COMPOSITION OF SEAWATER ENTERING AN AQUIFER EAN ACCUR

CHLORIDE IS THE DOMINANT ANION OF OCEAN WATER, IS UNAFFECTED BY THE
ABOVE PROCESSES. AND NORMALLY OCCURS IN ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS IN
GROUNDWATER.
5.
ON THE OTHER HAND. BICARBONATE IS USUALLY THE MOST ABUNDANT ANION IN
GROUNDWATER AND OCCURS IN ONLY MINOR AMOUNTS IN SEAWATER.
6.
ALTHOUGH POLLUTANTS OTHER THAN SEAWATER CAN CHANGE THE CHLORIDE-
BICARBONATE RATIO. THESE WOULD SELDOM BE IMPORTANT IN WATER COLLECTED
FROM A WELL SUBJECT TO INTRUSION.
C. METHOD : FOLIOWING ARE THE METHODS OF LIMIT SALTWATER INTRUSION :
1.
MODIFICATION OF PUMPING PATTERN :
I
CHANGING: THE LOCATION OF PUMPING WELLS. TYPICALLY BY DISPERSING THEM IN
INLAND AREAS. CAN AID IN REESTABLISHING A STRONGER SEAWARD HYDRAULIC
GRADMENT.
IL ALSO REDUCTION IN PUMPING OF EXISTING WELLS CAN PRODUCE THE SAME
BENEFICIAL EFFECT.
2
ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE:
I.
GROUNDWATER LEVELS CAN BE RAISED AND MAINTAINED BY ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE,
USING SURFACE SPREADING FOR UNCONFINED AQUIFERS AND RECHARGE WELLS FOR
CONFINED AQUIFERS.

A PHYSICAL MODEL IS A SCALED-DOWN MODEL OF A PROTOTYPE AQUIFER.
E
IN THE CASE OF PHYSICAL MODELS, SCALE FACTOR NEED TO BE CHOSEN, WHICH
RESULTS 20 CONVENIENT MODEL CHARACTERISTICS. THESE ARE CONVERSION
CONSTANTS THAT RELATE THE CORRESPONDING PARAMETERS AND VARIABLES OF
THE MODELS TO THOSE OF THE AQUIFER.
IN
AMONG THE PHYSICAL MODELS, A SAND TANK MODEL IS MOST COMMONLY
USED FOR SIMULATION OF SIMPLE AQUIFER SYSTEM.
IV. THE SAND TANK MODEL IS A SCALE MODEL OF AN AQUIFER WITH THE BOUNDARIES
SCALED DOWN AND THE ABSOLUTE VALUE AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE
BYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY MODIFIED.
V.
THESE MODELS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN WATER-TIGHT COLUMNAR OR WEDGE-SHAPED
BOXES MADE OF WOOD, PERSPEX, OR STEEL.
VI A UNIFORM BYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IN THE MODEL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY
PLACING COARSE SAND IN SMALL QUANTITIES UNDER WATER AND COMPACTING
CONSISTENTLY TO REMOVE AIR.

OF THE PHYSICAL PHENOMENON THAT ARE ANALOGOUS TO AND GOVERNED BY
SIMILAR MATHEMNTICAL FORMULAE AS GROUNDWATER FLOW IN POROUS MEDIA.
III. THESE ANALOGIES PROVIDE A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES FOR STUDYING THE
MOVEMENT OF GROUNDWATER AND MODELS BASED ON SUCH ANALOGY ARE
TERMED AS ANALOG MODELS.
IV.
ONE OF THE GREATEST. ADVANTAGES OF THE ANALOG MODELS IS THAT TIME NEED
NOT BE DISCRETIZED OTHERWISE THE NECESSITY OF USING TIME INCREMENTS IN
NUMERICAL MODELING IS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT OF AN AGGRAVATION AND SOURCE
OF POSSIBLE ERROR.
3.
MODEL-BASED ANALYTICAL FORMULAS COUPLED WITH EXPERIENCE :
I.
ANALYTICAL MODELS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE SOLUTION OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION. SUCH MODELS MAY BE DETERMINISTIC, STOCHASTIC. OR IT MAY BE A
COMBINATION OF BOTH.
II.
DETERMINISTIC MODELS ARE USED FOR SOLVING REGIONAL GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS
INVOLVING CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP OF KNOWN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES.
III.
STOCHASTIC MODELS WHICH ARE BASED ON PROBABILITIES OF OCCURRENCE CAN
BE USED IN PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES FOR THE GROUNDWATER
RESOURCES AND IN EVALUATING THE UNCERTAINTIES OF A SYSTEM.
IV. MODEL-BASED ANALYTICAL FORMULAS COUPLED WITH EXPERIENCE ARE ALWAYS
ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE APPLIED IN SOLVING A GROUNDWATER PROBLEM.
V.
THESE MODELS CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE TIME AND EFFORT IN ASSEMBLING A
SOLUTION TO A GROUNDWATER PROBLEM.

WHAT ARE THE SURFACE GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES AND EXPLAIN
ANY ONE OF THEM.
10
ANSWER
FOLLOWING ARE THE VARIOUS SURFACE GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES :
1.
GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION :
I.
GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION IS THE SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT OF PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES OF THE EARTH'S CRUST (SUBSURFACE FORMATIONS AND CONTAINED
FLUIDS) BY INSTRUMENTS LOCATED ON THE SURFACE FOR INVESTIGATION OF
GROUNDWATER.
II.
NOW A DAY, THE APPLICATION OF GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION TO GROUNDWATER
IS BECOMING COMMON.
III.
THE SUCCESS OF THESE METHODS DEPENDS ON HOW BEST THE PHYSICAL
PARAMETERS DEDUCED ARE INTERPRETED IN TERM OF AQUIFER PARAMETERS.
IV.
AS THE GEOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC OR ITS RANGE IS NOT UNIQUE, THE CHOICE
FROM MORE ALTERNATIVES IS BASED ON EXPERIENCE ON HYDROGEOLOGY OF THE
AREA.
V.
THUS, THESE METHODS ARE FREQUENTLY INEXACT AND ARE MOST USEFUL WHEN
SUPPLEMENTED BY OTHER METHODS.
VI.
GEOPHYSICAL METHODS DETECT DIFFERENCE OR ANOMALIES OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
SUCH AS DENSITY, MAGNETISM, ELASTICITY, AND ELECTRIC RESISTIVITY WITHIN
THE EARTH CRUST.

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT..
5-23 (CE-BEM-8)
2.
ELECTRIC RESISTIVITY METHOD :
I.
SURFACE ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY SURVEYING IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT
THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL IN THE GROUND AROUND A CURRENT-
CARRYING ELECTRODE DEPENDS ON THE ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITIES AND DISTRIBUTION
OF THE SURROUNDING SOILS AND ROCKS.
II.
ELECTRICAL METHODS CAN BE APPLIED TO DESCRIBE THE GEOLOGIE SETTING AND
PATTERNS OF GROUNDWATER EXISTENCE AND ITS QUALITY.
III.
IN THESE METHODS, GENERALLY ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (THE ABILITY OF A
MATERIAL TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY) OR ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY (THE RECIPROCAL
OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY) IS MEASURED.
IV.
THE COMMON ROCK-FORMING MINERALS HAVE VERY HIGH RESISTIVITY. ROCKA
AND SEDIMENTS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF IONS IN SOLUTION
IN THE PORE FLUID AND THE CHARGED LAYER PRESENT ON CLAY MINERALS.
V.
ELECTRIC RESISTIVITY OF ROCK OF FORMATION LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT
PASSING THROUGH THE FORMATION WHEN AN ELECTRIC POTENTIAL IS APPLIED.
VI.
THE CONDUCTANCE OF ELECTRICITY IS CONTROLLED BY THE CONTENT OF TOTAL
DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN GROUNDWATER AND THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF
CLAY MINERALS.
VII. THE HIGHER THE TDS IN THE PORE FLUID IN A FORMATION, THE LESSER THE
ELECTRIC RESISTIVITY.
VIII. SIMILARLY, THE HIGHER THE CLAY CONTENT IN THE FORMATION WITH THE SAME
PORE WATER CHEMISTRY, THE LESSER THE ELECTRIC RESISTIVITY AS THE CLAY
OFFERS VERY LOW RESISTIVITY.
IX.
RESISTIVITY IS HIGHER IN IGNEOUS ROCKS THAN IN METAMORPHIC ROCKS, AND
IT IS LESS IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.
X.
THE METAMORPHIC ROCKS CONTAIN HYDROUS MINERALS AND FABRIC, WHEREAS
THE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS CONTAIN ABUNDANT PORE SPACE AND FLUIDS.
XI.
IN, GENERAL, THE RESISTIVITY OF ROCK FORMATION DEPENDS ON MATERIALS,
DENSITY, POROSITY (PORE SIZE AND SHAPE), WATER CONTENT AND QUALITY, AND
TEMPERATURE. JOINTS AND FRACTURES PRESENT IN HARD ROCKS, WHEN SATURATED,
RESULTS IN LOW RESISTIVITY THAN THE ADJOINING MASSIVE ROCK.
3.
SEISMIC METHODS :
I.
SEISMIC METHODS UTILIZE BOTH REFLECTED AND REFRACTED ENERGY WAVES TO
MEASURE HOW FAST AND WHAT PATHS THESE WAVES TRAVEL THROUGH DIFFERENT
TYPES OF LITHOLOGIC UNITS.
II.
THE SEISMIC REFRACTION METHOD INVOLVES THE CREATION OF A SMALL SHOCK
AT A DEPTH OF ABOUT 1 M OR SO (KNOWN AS SHOT/SHOCK POINT) EITHER BY THE
IMPACT OF A HEAVY INSTRUMENT OR BY A SMALL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE.
III.
THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHOCK WAVES AT VARIOUS DISTANCES IS MEASURED WITH
SOUND DETECTORS CALLED GEOPHONES PLACED ON THE GROUND SURFACE.
IV.
THE CHANGE IN THE VELOCITY OF SEISMIC WAVES IS GOVERNED BY CHANGES IN
THE CLASTIC PROPERTIES OF THE FORMATION.

M
V.
THE TRAVEL TIME OF SEISMIC WAVE DEPENDS ON THE MEDIA THROUGH WHICH
IT PASSES.
VI. THE VELOCITY SEISMIC/SOUND WAVE IN SUBSURFACE MATERIAL INCREASES WITH
BULK DENSITY AND WATER CONTENT.
VIL. POROSITY TENDS TO DECREASE WAVE VELOCITY, BUT WATER CONTENT INCREASES
IT
VIII. IN COARSE ALLUVIAL MATERIALS, SEISMIC VELOCITY INCREASES MARKEDLY FROM
UNSATURATED TO SATURATED ZONES. THE VELOCITIES ARE GREATEST IN SOLID
IGNEOUS ROCKS (ABOUT 5,000 M/S) AND LEAST IN LOOSE UNCONSOLIDATED
UNSTURATED MATERIALS (ABOUT 250 M/S).
QUE 5.16.
THE RESISTIVITY OF SAMPLE OF FORMATION WATER REDUCED TO
A STANDARD TEMPERATURE OF 27 �C IS 15.2 OHM-M. IF THE FORMATION
RESISTIVITY READ FROM THE ELECTRIC LOG IS 131 OHM-M, DETERMINE THE
EFFECTIVE POROSITY OF THE FORMATION. ASSUME CEMENTATION FACTOR OF 2
IN THE ARCHIE'S FORMULA.

A.
RECHARGE :
I.
ADDITION OF SURFACE WATER TO ZONE OF SATURATION IS KNOWN AS RECHARGE.
II.
RECHARGE TAKING PLACE NATURALLY AS A PART OF HYDROLOGIC CYCLE IS CALLED
NATURAL RECHARGE WHILE THE PROCESS OF INCREASING INFILTRATION OF SURFACE
WATER TO GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS BY ALTERING NATURAL CONDITIONS IS KNOWN
AS ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE.
B.
TYPES : FOLLOWING ARE THE TWO TYPES OF RECHARGE :
1.
NATURAL RECHARGE :
I.
THE AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION THAT INFILTRATES INTO THE SOIL AND REACHES
THE ZONE OF SATURATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF NATURAL RECHARGE.
II.
SEEPAGE FROM IRRIGATED LANDS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF RECHARGE
OF GROUNDWATER.
III.
IN THIS PROCESS, THE INFILTRATION PHASE IS NATURAL WHILE THE SUPPLY OF
WATER TO THE IRRIGATED LANDS IS THROUGH ARTIFICIAL MEANS AND AS SUCH IT
IS SOMETIMES CALLED INCIDENTAL RECHARGE.

WHAT IS SOIL AQUIFER TREATMENT (SAT) AND HOW IT WORKS ?
-10

ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT.
5-27 C (CE-SEM-8)
ANSWER
A.
SOIL AQUIFER TREATMENT :
1.
SOIL AQUIFER TREATMENT (SAT) IS AN ARTIFICIAL GROUND WATER AQUIFER
RECHARGE.
2.
WATER IS INTRODUCED INTO THE GROUNDWATER THROUGH SOIL PERCOLATION
UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS.
3.
SOIL AQUIFER TREATMENT IS EITHER USED TO ARTIFICIALLY AUGMENT THE
GROUNDWATER IN ORDER TO WITHDRAW FRESHWATER AGAIN AT ALTER STAGE OR
AS A BARRIER TO PREVENT SALTWATER OR CONTAMINANTS FROM ENTERING THE
AQUIFER.
4.
DURING PERCOLATION, NATURAL SOIL FILTRATION OCCURS AND THE WATER ENTERS
THE AQUIFER WHERE MIXING AND POSSIBLY SOME OTHER PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL
REACTIONS MAY OCCUR.
5.
THIS METHOD CAN BE USED WITH RECLAIMED WATER (TREATED BLACKWATER)
OR RELATIVELY LITTLE POLLUTED WATER.
B.
WORKING OF SAT :
1.
SAT IS THE METHOD USED TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS FROM THE
SURFACE OR FROM BELOW THE SURFACE.
2.
TYPICALLY, SAT IS USED TO ENTER EITHER STORM WATER OR PRE-TREATED
WASTEWATER THROUGH A RECHARGE BASIN OR AN INJECTION WELL.
3.
AS THE EFFLUENT MOVES THROUGH THE SOIL AND THE AQUIFER, IT CAN UNDERGO
SIGNIFICANT QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
PROCESSES.
4.
THE WATER IS STORED IN THE UNDERLYING UNCONFINED AQUIFER GENERALLY
FOR SUBSEQUENT REUSE, SUCH AS IRRIGATION OR EVEN FOR DRINKING WATER
PURPOSES (GENERALLY AFTER A WATER PURIFICATION STEP).
5.
IN SHORT, SAT HAS BENEFITS BOTH IN TREATMENT IN THE DOMINANT UNSATURATED
ZONE, WHICH ACTS LIKE A NATURAL FILTER AND STORAGE WITHIN THE SATURATED
ZONE DEPENDING ON THE WASTEWATER QUALITY, LAND AVAILABILITY AND VARIOUS
PRE-TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL AND FREE-SURFACE
CONSTRUCTED WET LANDS, WASTE STABILIZATION PONDS, UASB REACTOR OR
ADVANCED TREATMENTS SUCH AS ACTIVATED SLUDGE PROCESS, MEMBRANE
FILTRATION ETC.

ANSWER
A.
ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE : REFER Q. 5.17, PAGE 5-24C, UNIT-5.
B.
ARTIFICIAL DISCHARGE :
1.
DISCHARGE REPRESENTS THE UPWARD OUTFLOW OF GROUNDWATER FROM THE
SUBSURFACE THAT OCCURS NATURALLY OR AS THE RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIVITY,
NOTABLY WELL PUMPING. WELL PUMPING IS ARTIFICIAL DISCHARGE OF
GROUNDWATER.

DRAWDOWN IS DEFINED AS THE DISTANCE BY WHICH THE PIEZOMETRIC SURFACE
15 LOWERED THUS. ONE OF THE GOALS OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCE STUDY IS TO
PREDICT HVDRAULIC-HEAD DRAWDOWNS IN AQUIFERS UNDER PROPOSED PUMPING
SCHEMES.
5
THE PUMPING WELL CREATES AN ARTIFICIAL DISCHARGE AREA BY DRAWING DOWN
(LOWERING) THE WATER TABLE AROUND THE WELL. THE CONE OF DEPRESSION IS
ATTRIBUTED TO A CONICAL-SHAPED DEPRESSION OF THE WATER TABLE AROUND A

C.
CATCHMENT APPROACH TO THE COMPUTATION OF RECHARGE =
1.
THIS METHOD ESTIMATES THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INFLOW AND OUSFLOW OF
WATER. HERE, THE VOLUME OF WATER REQUIRED TO SATURATE THE SOIL IS EXPRESSED
AS AN EQUIVALENT DEPTH OF WATER AND IS CALLED SOIL WATER DEFICIT.
2.
THE SOIL WATER BALANCE CAN BE REPRESENTED BY,
RI = P - EA +AW-RO
WHERE,
R1 = RECHARGE.
P = PRECIPITATION.
EA = ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,
AW = CHANGE IN SOIL WATER STORAGE.
RD = RUNOFF.
