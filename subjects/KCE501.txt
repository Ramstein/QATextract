Que 1.3.
Explain different types of transported soil.
Answer
Types of Transported Soils : Following are the various types of
transported soil :
1.
Water Transported Soils : Flowing water carries a large quantity of
soil either in suspension or by rolling along the bed.
All type of soils carried and deposited by water are known as alluvial
deposits. Deposits made in lakes are called lacustrine deposits.
2
Wind Transported Soils : Soil particles are transported by winds.
Soils deposited by wind are known as aeolian deposits. Loess is a silt
deposit made by wind.
3.
Glacier-Deposited Soils : As the glaciers melt and recede, material
contained in the ice is deposited on the ground leading to formation of
glacial deposits.
4
Gravity-Deposited Soils: Soils can be transported under the action of
gravity. Colluvial soils, such as talus, have been deposited by the gravity.
Que 1.4.
Explain the major groups of soil deposits in India.
Answer
The soil deposits in India may be classified in the following five major
groups :
1.
Alluvial Deposits :
i.
A large part of North India is covered with alluvial deposits.
ii.
The thickness of alluvium in the Indo-Gangetic and Brahmaputra flood
plains varies from a few metres to more than one hundred metres.
2.
Black Cotton Soils :
i
A
large part of Central India and a portion of South India is covered with
black cotton soils.
ii.
These soils are residual deposits formed from basalt or trap rocks. The
soils are quite suitable for growing cotton.
3.
Lateritic Soils : Lateritic soils are formed by decomposition of rock,
removal of bases and silica, and accumulation of iron oxide and aluminium
oxide. The presence of iron oxide gives these soils the characteristics red
or pink colour.
4.
Desert Soils : A large part of Rajasthan and adjoining states is covered
with sand dunes. In this area, arid condition exists, with practically little
rainfall.
5.
Marine Deposits : Marine deposits are mainly confined along a narrow
belt near the coast. In the south-west coast of India, there are thick
layers of sand above deep deposits of soft marine clays.

Factors Determine the Charaeteristics of a Residual Soil
:
Residual soils are products of chemical weathering and thus their
characteristics are dependent upon environmental factors of climate,
raw materials, parent material, topography and drainage, flow and age.
Que 1.6.
What do you mean by soil composition ?
Answer
1.
Soil is a complex physical system consisting of different phases.
2.
The term phase means any homogeneous part of the system different
from other parts of the system and separated from them by abrupt
transition.
3.
A mass of soils includes accumulated solid particles or soil grains and the
void spaces existing between the particles.
4.
The void spaces may be partially or completely filled with water or some
other liquid, and those not occupied by water or any other liquid are
filled with air or some other gas.
5.
The soil mass generally consist a three phase system like soil (solid),
water (liquid) and air (gas).

1-5A (CE-Sem-5)
6.
The three constituents of a soil mass do not occupy separate spaces but
are blended together forming a complex material as shown in
Fig. 1.6.l(a).
7.
When the soil voids are completely filled with water, the gaseous phase
being absent, the soil is said to be "fully saturated' or 'merely saturated'.

8.
When there is no water at all in the voids, the voids will be full of air, the
liquid phase being absent, the soil is said to be dry.
9.
In both these cases, the soil system reduces to a two-phase system as
shown in Fig. 1.6.1(c).
Que 1.7.
Define the basic terms which are related to soil system.
OR
Define void ratio, bulk unit weight and specific gravity.
AKTU 2016-17, Marks 02
Answer
Following are the basic terms which are related to soil system :
1
Void Ratio (e) :
i
It is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids.
Thus
e = V. V.
ii.
For coarse-grained soils, the void ratio is generally smaller than for fine-
grained soils. For some soils, it may have a value even greater than
unity.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-6 A (CE-Sem-5)
Origin and Classification of Soil
2
Porosity (n) :
i.
It is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume of soil.
Thus
n = V. V .
ii.
The porosity of a soil cannot exceed 100 % as it would mean v. is greater
U
than V. which is absurd. Porosity is also known as percentage voids.
3.
Degree of Saturation (S) :
i.
The degree of saturation (S) is the ratio of the volume of water to the
volume of voids,
Thus
S = V.
ii.
It is equal to zero when the soil is absolutely dry and 100 % when the soil
is fully saturated.
4.
Percentage Air Voids (n.) : It is the ratio of the volume of air to the
total volume of soil.
Thus
n.a = Yo
5.
Air Content (a,) :
i.
It is defined as the ratio of the volume of air to volume of voids.
Thus
a.- =
ii.
Both air content and the percentage air voids are zero when the soil is
saturated (V. = 0).
6.
Water Content (w) : It is defined as the ratio of the mass of water to
the mass of solids.
w = M. M,
The water content of some of the fine-grained soils may be even more
than 100 %, which indicates that more than 50 % of the total mass is that
of water.
7.
Bulk Unit Weight :
i.
The bulk unit weight (y) is defined as the total weight per unit total
volume. Thus
=
v/
W
Y
ii.
The bulk unit weight is also known as the total unit weight (yp). or the
wet unit weight.
8.
Dry Unit Weight (Yd) : It is defined as the weight of solids per unit total
volume. Thus
Yd - IV =
Scanned with CamScanner
Geotechnical Engineering
1-7. (CE-Sem-5)
a
Saturated Unit Weight (Yame) : It is the bulk unit weight when the soil
is fully saturated.
Thus
=
10. Submerged Unit Weight (r") : The submerged unit weight of the soil
is defined as the submerged weight of soil per unit of total volume.
Thus
= W
V
11. Specific Gravity of Solids : The specific gravity of solid particles (G) is
defined as the ratio of the mass of a given volume of solids to the mass
of an equal volume of water at 4°C. Thus, the specific gravity is given by,
G=P
P.
The mass density of water Pw at 4°C is 1 gm/ml, 1000 kg/m³ or 1 Mg/m³.

1.
This method is n standard, laboratory method.
2.
In this method, water content is computed in following steps :
Scanned with CamScanner
Geotechnical Engineering
1-11 A (CE-Sem-5)
i.
Moist sample of soil whose moisture content is to be determined is
placed in an empty container of weight (M1).
ii.
Let the weight of container with moist soil sample be (M2).
iii.
The container with moist soil is placed in a temperature control oven for
drying at the temperature of 110 + 5 °C.
iv.
For inorganic soil like sand drying is require for 4 hours and for clays
and silt drying is require for 12-16 hours.
v.
After drying weight of container with dry soil is noted (M3).
And now,
Water content, E = M2 - M3 x 100
M3-M1 -
B.
Sand Bath Method :
1.
This is a field method for determination of water content.
2.
A sand bath is large open vessel containing sand filled to a depth of 5 cm
or more.
3.
The soil is taken in a tray. It is crumbled. A few pieces of white paper are
also kept on the sample.
4.
Mass of wet sample is obtained by weighing the tray.
5.
The tray is then placed on sand bath.
6.
The sand bath is heated over a stove.
7.
During heating. the sample is turned with a palette knife. Overheating
of soil should be avoided. The white paper turns brown when overheating
occurs.
8.
When drying is complete, the tray is removed, cooled and weighted.
9.
The water content is determined by,
w= Mex100% E =
C. Alcohol Method :
1.
The sample is broken, crumbled and taken in an evaporating dish.
2.
The mass of wet sample is taken (M1).
3.
The sample is then mixed with alcohol.
4.
About one millitre of alcohol is added for every gram of soil.
5.
The alcohol is then ignited. The mixture is turned with spatula when
ignition is taken place.
6.
After the alcohol is burnt away completely, the dish is allowed to cool
and mass of dry soil is obtained (M2.

8.
This method cannot be used if the soil contains large proportion of
organic matter, gypsum and any other calcareous materials.
D.
Calcium Carbide Method :
1.
This method can be used in the field and in the laboratory too.
2.
The instrument used is known as rapid moisture tester.
3.
This method makes use of fact that when water reacts with calcium
carbide, acetylene gas is generated.
4.
The acetylene gas produced exerts pressure and it is recorded in the dial
gauge attached to the moisture tester.
5.
The soil sample of 6 grams is taken in the test cylinder containing
calcium carbide.
6.
The soil sample is required to be ground and pulverized.
7.
The quantity of gas produced is indicated on the dial gauge in terms of
pressure.
8.
From the calibrated scale of pressure gauge, the moisture content based
on total mass is determined.
9.
The water content (w) based on dry mass is calculated as,
w = - W 100%
where, W = Weight of sample.

This, along with the two negative charges at the apex, makes total of
five negative charges to four positive charges of the silicon ion. Thus,
there is a net (-1) per unit.

AKTU 2018-19, Marks 07
Answer
Clay Minerals : The clay materials are basically composed of tiny
crystalline substance of one or more members of a small group of
minerals-commonly known as clay minerals. Most common clay
minerals are given below :
A.
Kaolinite :
1.
Kaolinite is the most common minerals of the kaolinite group of clay
minerals.
2.
Its basic structural unit consists of gibbsite sheet (G) with aluminium
atoms at the centre.
3. It is joined to silica shect (S) through the unbalanced oxygen atoma at
the apexes of the silica sheet.
4.
The total thickness of the basic structural units is about 7 AL

6.
The basic structural units of kaolinite mineral are joined together by
hydrogen bond. It develops between the oxygen atoms of silica sheet
and the hydroxyls of gibbsite sheet.
7.
Since the hydrogen bond is fairly strong, it is extremely difficult to
separate the layers, and hence, kaolinite mineral is relatively stable.
8.
Moreover, water cannot penetrate through the layers of the structural
units of kaolinite minerals.
9.
Kaolinite shows relatively little swell on wetting.
10. China clay is almost pure kaolinite.
B. Montmorillonite :
1.
Montmorillonite is the most common mineral of the montmorillonite
group of clay minerals.
2.
Its basic structural unit consists of gibbsite sheet (G) sandwiched between
two silica sheets (S).
3.
The gibbsite sheet may include atoms of aluminium, iron or magnesium,
or a combination of these.
4.
The total thickness of basic structural unit of montmorillonite is about
10 A.
5.
The basic structural units of montmorillonite mineral arejoined together
by a link between oxygen ions of the two silica sheets.
6.
The link is due to natural attraction for the cations in the intervening
space and due to Vander Waal forces.
7.
Water may enter between the silica sheets causing the mineral to swell.
8.
For this reason, montmorillonite tends to expand on wetting.

minerals.

2
Its basic structural unit is similar to that of montmorillonite mineral
except that there is always substantial (20%*) substitution of silicon
atoms by aluminium atoms in silica sheet.
3.
Also, the link between the different basic structural units is through
non- exchangeable potassium (K+) ions.

Thus, the properties of illite are somewhat intermediate between those
of kaolinite and montmorillonite.

Write short note on :
1.
Single-grained structure.
2
Honey comb-structure,
3
Flocculated structure.
Answer
1.
Single-Grained Structure :
i.
Cohesionless soils, such as gravel and sand, are composed of bulky
grains in which the gravitational forces are more predominant than
surface forces.
il
When deposition of these soils occurs, the particles settle under
gravitational forces and take an equilibrium position as shown in
Fig. 1.22.1(a). Each particle is in contact with those surrounding it. The
soil structure so formed is known as single-grained structure.

(b) Honey-comb structure
Fig. 1.22.1.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-24 A (CE-Sem-5)
Origin and Classificatio of Soil
2.
Honey-Comb Structure :
i.
It is possible for fine sands or silts to get deposited such that the particles
when settling develop a particle-to-particle contact that bridges over
large voids in the soil mass [Fig. 1.22.1(b)]. The particles wedge between
one another into a stable condition and form a skeleton like an arch to
carry the weight of the overlying material. The structure so formed is
known as honey-comb structure.
ii.
The honey-comb structure usually develops when the particle size is
between 0.002 mm and 0.02 mm.
iii.
Honey-comb structure occurs in soils having small granular particles
which have cohesion because of their fineness. Soils in honey-comb
structure are loose.
3.
Flocculated Structure :
i.
Flocculated structure occurs in clays. The clay particles have large surface
area and, therefore, the electrical forces are important in such soils.
ii.
The clay particles have a negative charge on the surface and a positive
charge on the edges.
iii.
Interparticle contact develops between the positively charged edges and
the negatively charged faces. This results in a flocculated structure as
shown in Fig. 1.23.2.

Answer
Particle-Size Analysis :
1.
Particle size analysis is an analytical technique by which the distribution
of sizes in a sample of soil is measured and reported.
2.
Percentage of different size of particles present in a given dry sample of
soil is computed by particle size analysis or mechanical analysis,
3.
It is generally being carried out in two stages :
i.
Sieve analysis.
ii.
Sedimentation analysis/wet mechanical analysis.
A.
Sieve Analysis :
1.
Sieve analysis is being carried out for coarse grained particle having size
greater than 0.075 mm (75 um).
2.
Sieve analysis is further of two types :
i.
Coarse sieving (4.75 < d < 80 mm).

Dry
Wet (done only when silt + clay is present)
3.
Sieves are designed by the size of aperture in mm as per IS : 460-1962,
4.
Wet sieving is carried out for separating fine grains from coarse grains
by washing the soil specimen on a 75 micron sieve mesh.
5.
Dry sieve analysis is carried out on particles coarser than 75 micron.
Samples (with fines removed) are dried and shaken through a set of
sieves of descending size. The weight retained in each sieve is measured.
The cumulative percentage quantities finer than the sieve sizes (passing
each given sieve size) are then determined.
6.
The resulting data is presented as a distribution curve with grain size
along X-axis (log scale) and percentage passing along Y-axis (arithmetic
seale),

OR
What are the limitations in the use of Stoke's law in sedimentntion
analysis 7
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 10
Answer
A.
Sedimentation Analysis :
1. It is being carried out for the particles having size less than 0.075 mm
(fine grain particles).
2 Particles having size less than 0.0002 mm cannot be analyzed even by
sedimentation These particles can be analyzed by electron microscope
or by X-ray diffraction.
3.
This analysis is based on Stoke's law. According to Stoke's law, velocity
of particle during settlement, that is assumed to be spherical, is dependent
upon shape, size and mass of the particle and keeping all the other
factors constant.
V

rhere,
G = Specific gravity,
P = Kinematic viscosity.
B.
Limitations : Following are the limitations of Stoke's law :
1.
Stoke's law is applicable only when the liquid is infinite. The presence of
walls of the jar affects the results to some extent.
2
In Scoke's law, it has been assumed that only one sphere settles, and
there is no interference from other spheres. In the sedimentation
analysis, as many particles settle simultaneously, there is some
interfereace.
Scanned with CamScanner

Origin and Classification of Soil
3.
The sedimentation analysis cannot be used for particles larger than
0.2 mm as turbulent conditions develop and Stoke's law is not applicable.
4.
The sedimentation method is not applicable for particles smaller than
0.2 because Brownian movement takes place and the particles do not
settle as per Stoke's law.

What is hydrometer ? Explain all the corrections which
are used in hydrometer analysis.
Answer
A.
Hydrometer : A hydrometer is an instrument used for determining
the specific gravity of liquids. As the specific gravity of the soil suspension
depends upon the particle size, a hydrometer can be used for the particle
size analysis.
B.
Corrections in Hydrometer Analysis : Following are the corrections
applied in observed hydrometer analysis :
1.
Meniscus Correction :
i.
The hydrometer reading of lower meniscus is to be taken. But since the
soil suspension is opaque the reading of upper meniscus is taken instead
of lower meniscus. Because of this an error is introduced.
ii.
A correction due to meniscus Cm) is then applied to the hydrometer
reading.
2.
Temperature Correction :
i.
Hydrometers are calibrated at a temperature of 27°C.
ii.
In case the temperature of the suspension is different from 27°C. a
correction due to temperature (+ CP is to be applied to the observed
hydrometer readings.
iii.
If the test temperature is above the standard, the correction is added
and, if below. it is subtracted.
3.
Dispersion Agent Correction :
i.
The correction due to rise in specific gravity of the suspension on account
of the addition of the deflocculating/dispersing agent is called the
dispersing agent correction (CA). Cd is always negative.
ii.
The corrected hydrometer reading R. is given by,
R. = Ry+Cm+C-Cd
where,
R1 = Observed hydrometer reading.
R. correct hydrometer reading used in the calibration graph to obtain
the effective depth H,

Write short note on thixotropy of clay.
Answer
1.
When naturally formed clays are remoulded, their original clay structure
is destroyed and they lose their strength.
2
The loss of strength of a soil due to remoulding is partly due to change in
the soil structure and partly due to disturbance caused to water molecules
in the absorbed layer.
3.
Some of these changes are reversible.
4.
If a remoulded soil is allowed to stand, without loss of water, it may
regain some of its lost strength.

A. Plasticity Index : It is the range of water content over which the soil
remains in the plastic state. It is equal to the difference between the
liquid limit and plastic limit.
Thus,

The line shown in Fig. 1.30.1 separates silts from clays.
3.
In the plasticity chart, the liquid limit (LL) of a given soil determines ita
plasticity. Soils are classified on the bases of LL as follows :
i.
LL < 35 = Low-plasticity clays (or low-compressibility).
ii.
35 < LL s 50 Medium-plasticity clays (or nedium-compressibility
silts).
iii.
LL > 50 = High-plasticity clays for high-compressibility silts.
4.
To determine the state of a natural soil with an in-situ moisture content
uv. we can use the liquidity index (LD, defined as
L1= W-PL =
LL-PL
5.
For heavily overconsolidated clays, w < PL and therefore LI < o, and the
soil is classified as nonplastic (i.c., brittle); if PL <w < LL),
the soil is in its plastic state; and if LI > 1 (i.e., w > LL), the soil is in its
liquid state.
Que 1.31. The liquid limit of clay is 64% and its plastic limit is 34%.
Its natural water is 48 %- What is the liquidity index of the soil ? How
do you classify the soil as per the IS classification ?
AKTU 2019-20, Marks 07
Answer
Given : Liquid limit, WL = 64 %, Plastic limit, Wp =34%, Natural water
content, u = 48 %
To Find : Liquidity index and Classify the soil.
1.
Plasticity index, 1p P = WL - "p = 64 % - -34%=30%
2.
Liquidity index is given by,
= - x 100 = 48-34 x 46.67 %
=
30
3.
On the basis of liquid limit (64%). A-line is given by,
If. = 0.73 (we - 20) = 0.73 (64 - 20) = 32.12 % > 30%
Hence, Atterberg limit plot below A-line. Therefore soil is organic clay of
medium to high plasticity.
Que 1.32.
The plastic limit of soils is 24 % and its plasticity index is
8
%. When the soil is dried from its state of plastic limit, the volume
change is 26 % of its volume of plastic limit. The corresponding
volume change from liquid limit to dry state is 35 % of its volume of
liquid limit. Determine the shrinkage limit and the shrinkage ratio.

If the material of the base of the liquid limit apparatus
on which the bowl containing soil drops is made of sponge, will the
measured value of liquid limit of the soil be lower or higher than
that measured using the standard apparatus which has a base made
of hard rubber ? Discuss the result.
Scanned with CamScanner
Engineering
Answer
The liquid limit is less in sponge as compare to hard rubber. Followa
reasons nre responsible for less liquid limit
:
1 When hard rubber is used. it can bear the shocks of the cup during la
It will behave like a hard surface. Due to this, the soil displaces from:
place. This will show that how much liquid is available in that sample)
will show higher liquid limit than spongy material surface as sbork
energy 25 aborbed by sponge and soil will not move. Hence, it posseste
low liquid limit.
2
From classification curve of Atterberg. we can say that if the wate
content 15 less in soil, it will behave like a plastic material as in cased
spongy surface in which the soil does not move, will behave as plastir e
solid soil or possesses less liquid limit.

Que 2.1.
Define the term total stress, pore water stress and
effective stress for given soil.
Answer
1.
Total Stress :
i.
When a load is applied to soil, it is carried by the solid grains and the
water in the pores.
ii.
The total vertical stress acting at a point below the ground surface is due
to the weight of everything that lies above, including soil, water and
surface loading.
Vertical total stress at height h, a =
h
iii.
Total stress thus increases with height and with unit weight.
2.
Pore Water Pressure :
i.
Pore water pressure (u) is the pressure due to pore water filling the
voids of the soil. Thus
=
ii.
Pore water pressure is also known as neutral pressure or neutral stress,
because it cannot resist shear stresses.
3.
Effective Stress :
i.
The effective stress (a ) at a point in the soil mass is equal to the total
stress minus the pore water pressure. Thus,
ii.
For saturated soils, it is obtained as :
o
= Yeat h - Ye h = =
where,
Y = Submerged unit weight.

where,
t = Coefficient of permeability.
i = Hydraulic gradient.
As = Difference in total heads.
L = Length of the soil mass.
Validity of Darcy's Law
:
1.
Darcy's law is valid if the flow through soils is laminar.
2
It is valid for flow in clays, silts and fine sands. In coarse sands, gravels
and boulders, the flow may be turbulent and Darcy's law may not be
applicable.
3.
For Darcy's law to the valid, the relationship between velocity (v) and
hydraulic gradient (i) should be linear.
4.
In extremely fine-grained soils, such as colloidal clay, the interstices are
very small. The velocity is therefore very small. In such soils, the Darcy's
law is not valid.

Define permeability. Explain the laboratory methods to
find permeability coefficient.
OR
What are different methods for determination of the coefficient of
permeability in a laboratory ? Discuss their limitations.
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 10
Answer
A
Permeability : It is the property of a porous medium which permits
slow movement of free or gravitational water (or other fluids) through
its interconnecting voids.
B.
Laboratory Methods : The coefficient of permeability of a soil can be
determined by using the following methods :
1.
Constant Head Permeability Test :
i
Constant-head tests are used for estimating the coefficient of
permeability of coarse-grained soils of high permeability, such as clean
sands and gravel
il
Fig. 2.8.1 shows the arrangement in which the flow is one-dimensional
and in downward direction.
iii.
The figure also indicates the head loss (h,) and the corresponding length
of soil, L. over which the head loss occurs.
iv.
The experimental data consist of a measured quantity of discharge Q
during a time interval f, under steady state conditions of flow. The head
loss h, is also noted.

k can be computed from the formula,
k =
where,
Q = Quantity of discharge in time t.

The discharge through the flow channel between the two flow lines in
two soils is given by,
Ag, = k, (Ah/As,) An,

it.

Case (ii), k, <k,:

Fig. 2.11.1(b) shows the case when the flow takes place from a soil of low
permeability to that of high permeability.

At the interface, the flow line is deflected away from the normal.

As ke > k, the angle a2 is greater than angle a, and the flow line deflects

Discuss the factors that influence permeability of soil
Answer
Following are the factors affecting the permeability of soils :
1.
Properties of Pore Fluid:
i.
Pore fluids are fluids that occupy pore spaces in a soil or rock.
n.
Permeability is directly proportional to the unit weight of pore fluid and
inversely proportional to viscosity of pore fluid.
2
Void Ratio : Increase in the void ratio increases the area available for
flow bence permeability increases for critical conditions.
3.
Entrapped Air and Organic Impurities : The organic impurities and
entrapped air obetruct the flow and coefficient of permeability is reduced
due to their presence.
4
Advorbed Water:
i
Adsorbed water means a thin microscopic film of water surrounding
individual noil grains.
ii.
This water is not free to move and hence reduces the effective pore
#pace and thus decreases coefficient of permeability.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-20 A (CE-Sem-5)
Soil Hydraulics
5.
Shape of Particles : Permeability is inversely proportional to specific
surface e.g-. as angular soil have more specific surface area compared to
the round soil therefore, the soil with angular particles is less permeable
than soil of rounded particles.

Answer
1.
When flow takes place in upward direction, seepage pressure also acts
vertically upward which results in decrease of effective pressure in the
soil.
2.
If seepage pressure is such that it equals the submerged weight of soil,
effective stress reduces to zero.
3.
In such condition shear strength of cohesionless soil mass is zero and
soil particles have tendency to flow with water.
4.
In this process, soil particles leave the soil mass.
5.
This condition is called quick sand condition.
a=Zi-p,0
Zy = P,
Zy=iZy =
=
=
Er=19-117.
Y

6.
The hydraulic gradient at which quick sand condition occurs is termed
as critical gradient, piping gradient and floating gradient.
7.
For fine sand and silt, specific gravity is approximately 2.65 and void
ratio 0.65, then critical gradient is approximately unity.
2.65 1 1.65
i < = - =
1
1 +0.65 1.65
= 1
€
8.
To avoid quick sand condition Ti" should be less than critical hydraulic
gradient.
Hence,
FOS =
is
9.
In cohesive soils like clay due to their inherent cohesion, shear strength
is not reduced to zero even if effective stress reduces to zero.
10.
Hence particles in the cohesive soils are held due to inherent cohesion
and does not leave the soil masseven if effective stresses becomes zero.

Write a short note on :
i. Capillarity.
El Uplift pressure.
Answer
A. Capillarity
1
The bright above the water table to which the soil is saturated is called
capillary rise and this pbenomenon called capillarity.
2
Above the water table. when the soil is saturated. pore pressure willb
negative less than atmospheric).
s Capillary depends on the grain size and the size of pore.
4.
In coarse grained soils the capillary rise is very small compare to fite
grained souls.
B. Uplift Pressure:
1
Uplif pressure at any given point is the pore water pressure acting
vertically upward due to the residual pressure head at that point
2
The diagram of distribution of uplift pressure along the base of the das
can be drawn and the total uplift force then calculated by working on
the area of the uplift pressure distribution diagram.
3 Uplift force is an important consideration in the stability of a masonry
dam
4.
The total uplit farce acts opposite the force of gravity due to the weigh
of the dam and bence reduces the stability of the hydraulic structure
5. Uplift pressure alang the base of masonry dams can be effectively reduced
by providing vertical cut off walls at the upstream end of the base of the
dam

What is piping in hydraulic structure ? Suggest some
fial measure to check or prevent it.
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 10
Answer
A. Piping
1 1: in a permons which occurs due to erosion by sub-surface water
maring through a soil mass.
2
It resulte in the formation of continuous tunnels or pipe-like formations
through which soil is carried by flowing water and piping failure may
uccur
B. Preventions of Piping Failures : The following measures are
geterally adverted to prevent piping failures :
1. Incrvasing the Path of Percolation :
Scanned with CamScanner
2-28 A (CE-Sem-5)
Hydraulica
i
The hydraulic gradient (i) depends upon the path of percolation (L). If
the length of the path is increased. the exit gradient will decrease to a
safe value.
H.
The length of the path of percolation can be increased by adopting the
following methods:
a.
Increasing the base width of the hydraulic structure
b.
Providing vertical cut off walla below the hydraulic structure
c.
Providing an upetream impervious blanket, as shown in Fig. 2.23.1.
2
Reducing Seepage:
i.
With a reduction of seepage through the dam. the chances of piping
failure through the body of the dam are considerably reduced.
ii.
The quantity of seepage discharge is reduced by providing an impervious
core, as shown in Fig. 2.23.1.
3
Providing Drainage Filter
i.
A drainage filter changes the direction of flow away from the downstream
face.
ii.
It prevents the movement of soil particles along with water
iii.
The drainage filter may be horizontal or in the form of a rock the It may
also be in the form of a chimney drain. as shown in Fig. 2.23.1.
iv.
A chimney drain is effective for stratified soil deposits in which the
horizontal permeability is greater than the vertical permeability.
4.
Loaded Filter :
i.
A loaded filter consists of graded sand and gravels. The function of the
loaded filter is to increase the downward force without increasing the
upward scepage force.
ii. The loaded filter is placed at the exit point where the water emerges
from the foundation
iii. For the sheet pile wall, the filter is placed over the affected zone.
iv.
The loaded filter increases the factor of safety against heave piping. The
factor of safety (F) is given by.
W' W
F =
U
where W is the weight of filter.
V.
The loaded filter should be of pervious material such that it does not
increase the hydrostatic preasure. It should only increase the downward
force.

Explain capillary siphoning with neat sketch. Also
discuss about partially saturated soil.
AKTU 2018-19, Marks 07
Answer
Capillary Siphoning :
1.
In an earth dam with an impervious core, capillary siphoning may occur
as shown in Fig. 2.24.1.
Capillary siphoning
(water spills over core)
Shell
Core
Fig. 2.24.1. Capillary siphoning.
2.
The water rises in the outer shell due to capillary action. If the crest (top
level) of the impervious core is in the reach of capillary rise, water flows
from the storage reservoir to the downstream over the core.
3.
Considerable quantity of stored water may be lost to capillary siphoning
4.
To prevent this, the crest of the impervious core should be kept
sufficiently high.
5.
In other words, the difference of top level of the core and water level in
the reservoir should be more than the capillary rise in soil of the shell.
Partially Saturated Soil :
1.
Generally the soil is made up of three phases, which are called as soil
solid. water and air.
2.
If the pore or void space in the soil is fully occupied by the water, then it
is fully saturated.
3.
If the voids space in the soil is partially occupied by water, the pore is said
to be partially saturated.
4.
It is found using the degree of saturation value.
5.
If the value is in between o to 100 %, then the soil is partially saturated.
Que 2.25. As a geotechnical engineer for the design of n filter of an
earth dam, the proper selection of filter material is required to
prevent the piping failure, so what are the conditions, you will keep
in your mind at the time of filter design ?
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 10
Answer
1.
When seepage water flows from a soil with relatively fine grains into a
coarser material, there is a danger that the fine soil particles may was
away into the coarse material.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-30 A (CE-Sem-5)
Soil Hydraulics
2.
Over a period of time, this process may clog the void spaces in the
coarser material.
3.
Such a situation can be prevented by the use of a filter or protective
filter between the two soils.
4.
For example, consider the earth dam section shown in Fig. 2.25.1.
5.
If rock fills were only used at the toe of the dam, the seepage water
would wash the fine soil grains into the toe and undermine the structure.
6.
Hence, for the safety of the structure, a filter should be placed between
the fine soil and the rock toe as shown in Fig. 2.25.1.
Filter
Soil to be
Rock toe
protected
Fig. 2.25.1. Use of filter at the toe of an earth dam.
7. For the proper selection of the filter material, two conditions should be
kept in mind :
i.
The size of the voids in the filter material should be small enough to hold
the larger particles of the protected material in place.
ii.
The filter material should have a high permeability to prevent building
of large seepage forces and hydrostatic pressure in the filter.
iii.
The filter material specifications are given below :

to
the
next is h/N.. The total head at any point can be determined as :
h = - n x (h/Nd)
where, n = Number of the equipotential drops upto consider point.
3.
Pressure Head : The pressure at any point is equal to the total head
minus the elevation head.
The pressure head is given by,
h = h-(-h)=h+h, -
where,
h = Pressure head at P.
hi = Elevation head at P.
h = Total head.
4.
Hydraulic Gradient : The average value of hydraulic gradient for any
flow field is given by,
i = Ah/As
where,
As = Length of the flow.
Ah = Loss of head.

Questions-Answers
Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 3.1.
What is compaction ? What kind of improvement of the
engineering properties of a soil mass can be brought about through
compaction ?
Answer
A.
Compaction : It means pressing the soil particles close to each other by
mechanical methods. During compaction, air is expelled from the void
space in the soil mass.
B.
Effects of Compaction on Engineering Properties of Soil :
Following are the engineering properties affected by the compaction of
soil.
1.
Permeability : The effect of compaction is to decrease the permeability.
In the case of fine grained soils it has been found that for the same dry
density soil compacted wet of optimum will be less permeable than that
of compacted dry of optimum.
2
Compressibility : In case of soil samples initially saturated and having
same void ratio, it has been found that in low pressure range a wet side
compacted soil is more compressible than a dry side compacted soil. and
vice versa in high pressure range.
3.
Pore Pressure :
i.
In undrained shear test conducted on saturated samples of clay it has
been found that lower pore pressures develop at low strains when the
sample is compacted dry of optimum, compared to the case when the
sample is compacted wet of optimum.
ii.
But at high strains in both types of samples the development of pore
pressure is same for same density and water content.
4.
Stress-Strnin Relation : Samples compacted dry of optimum produce
much steeper stress-strain curves with peaks at low strains, whereas
samples compacted wet of optimum, having the same density, produce
much flatter stress-strain curves with increase in stress even at high
strains.

Geotechnical Engineering
3-3 A (CE-Sem-5)
5.
Shrinkage and Swelling :
i.
At same density a soil compacted dry of optimum shrinks appreciably
less than that of compacted wet of optimum.
il
Also the soil compacted dry of optimum exhibits greater swelling
characteristics than samples of the same density compacted wet of
optimum.
Que 3.2.
What are the factors that affect the compaction ?
Answer
Factors Affecting the Compaction : Following are factors that affect
the compaction :
1.
Water Content : As the water content is increased, the compacted
density goes on increasing: till a maximum dry density is achieved after
which further addition of water decreases the density.
2
Amount of Compaction
:
i.
The amount of compaction greatly affects the maximum dry density and
optimum water content of a given soil.
il
The effect of increasing the compactive energy results in an increase in
the maximum dry density and decrease in the optimum water content.
3.
Method of Compaction : The density obtained during compaction, for
a given soil. greatly depends upon the type of compaction or the manner
in which the compactive effort is applied.
4.
Type of Soil : The maximum dry density achieved corresponding to
a
given compactive energy largely depends upon the type of soil.
5.
Admixture :
i
The compaction characteristics of the soils are improved by adding ot her
materials known as admixtures.
il
The most commonly used admixtures are lime, cement and bitumen.

AKTU 2016-17, Marks 15
OR
What are various types of field compacting equipments ? Which
types of rollers are suited for clayey and gravel soils ? Also give
specifications of such rollers.
Answer
Method of Compaction : The three methods of compaction used in
practice are ramming, rolling and vibrations.
A.
Ramming :
1.
In this method of soil compaction, tampers are used.
2
A hand-operated tamper (or rammer) consists of a block of iron (or
stone), about 3 to 5 kg in mass, attached to a wooden rod. The tamper is
lifted for about 0.30 m and dropped on the soil to be compacted.
3.
A mechanical rammer is operated by compressed air or gasoline power.
Scanned with CamScanner
3-4 A (CE-Sem-5)
Soil Compaction & Consolidation
It is much heavier, about 30 to 150 kg. Mechanical rammers have been
used upto a mass of 1000 kg in some special cases.
4.
Tampers are used to compact soils adjacent to existing structures or
confined areas, such as trenches and behind the bridge abutments,
where other methods of compaction cannot be used.
5.
Owing to very low output, tampers are not economical where large
quantities of soils are involved. Tampers can be used for all types of soils.
B. Rolling : Rolling of soil is done by various types of rollers.
1.
Smooth Wheel Roller :
i.
A smooth-wheel roller generally consists of three wheels; two large
wheels in the rear and one small wheel in the front.
ii.
A tandem type smooth-wheel roller consists of only two drums; one in
rear and one in the front.
iii. The mass of a smooth-wheel roller generally varies between 2 to 15 Mg.
iv.
In these types of rollers compaction is achieved by the application of
pressure over the soil mass.
v.
These are generally suitable for crushed stones, gravel and sand
(coarse grained soil).
vi. This is generally used for road construction
2
Sheep Foot Roller :
i.
This type of roller has many round and rectangular shaped projections
or feet attached to a steel drum.
ii.
One foot has 50 to 100 cm² surface area and 150 to 250 mm feet projection
from the drum surface.
iii.
As the coverage is about 8 to 12%, very high contact pressure, ranging
from 1400 to 7000 kPa, depending upon the size of drum and whether
the drum is partly or fully filled by water or sand.
iv. This type of roller compaction is achieved by kneading action which
provides comparatively stronger bond between compacting layers of the
soil mass.
v.
These are generally used for the construction of core of earthen dam
(cohesive soils such as clay and silt).
3.
Pneumatic Tyred Roller :
i.
This type of roller consists of a box or platform mounted between two
axles. The rear axle has one wheel more than at the front.
n.
This roller has about 80 % coverage, i.e., 80 ° % of the total area is covered
by tyres.
iii.
The tyre pressure in small rollers is of the order of 250 kPa where as in
heavier rollers, it may range between 400 and 1050 kPa.
iv.
The soils are usually compacted in about 200 mm thick layers with 8 to
10 passes of the rollers.
v.
In these rollers, compaction is achieved by use of both pressure and
kneading action.
vi.
These are suitable for all types of soil but are generally used for cohesive
soils.
vii. These are used for construction of air fields, roadways and earthen
dams.

attached to the wheel axle The ballast boz is guspended separately
from the axle so that it does not vibrate. These compactors are suitable
for compacting granular soils with thickness of layer of about 30
5.
Another form of a vibratory compactor is a vibrating-plate compactor.
In this system, there are number of small plates, each plate is operated
by a separate vibrating unit Hand-operated vibrating plates are alm
available. The effect of the vibrating plates is limited to small deptha
7.
The main use is to compact granular base courses for highways and
runways where the thickness of layers is small.

control the compaction in a site; so how will you control the
compaction by the Proctor's needle method ?
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 05
Answer
A.
Field Control of Compaction :
1.
The field compaction control consists of the determination of :
i.
The water content at which the soil has been compacted, and
ii.
The dry density (or dry unit weight) achieved.
2.
To attain a desired density by compaction, periodic mneasurements of
moisture content and dry density will be required during the compaction
process.

Que 3.9.
What do you mean by compressibility of soil ?
Answer
1.
The property of the soil due to which decrease in volume occurs under
compressive forces is known as the compressibility of soil.
2.
When the soil mass is subjected to a compressive force, like all other
materials, its volume decreases.
3.
The compression of soils can occur due to one or more of the following
reasons :
i.
Compression of solid particles and water in the voids.
ii.
Compression and expulsion of air in the voids.
iii.
Expulsion of water in voids.
4.
Compression of soil also takes place by expulsion of air from the voids
under a vibratory load; such n compression is usually known as
compaction.
5.
In n saturated soil mass having its voids filled with incompressible water,
decrease in volume or compression can takes place when water is
expelled out of the voids. Such a compression resulting from a long term
static load and the consequent escape of pore water is termed as a
consolidation

Write a short note on :
A. Inmediate settlement.
B. Primary consolidation-
C. Secondary consolidation.
Answer
A.
Immediate Settlement:
L
Immediate or elastic settlement takes place during or immediatet after
the construction of the structure.
2
It is also known 25 the distortion settlement as it is due to distertions
(and not the volume change) within the foundation soil
3. Although the settlement is not truly elastic, it is computed using elastic
theory. especially for cohesive soils.
B. Primary Consolidation :
1.
After initial consolidation, further reduction in volume occurs due to the
expulsion of water from the voids.
2
When saturated soil is subjected to a pressure, initially all the pressure
is taken up by the water as an excess pore water pressure.
3.
As water is almost incompressible as compared with solid particles. A
hydraulic gradient develops and water starts flowing out and decrease
in volume occurs.
4.
The decrease depends upon the permeability of soil and is therefore,
time dependent
5.
This reduction in volume is called primary consolidation.
C.
Secondary Consolidation :
1.
The reduction in volume continues at a very alow rate even after the
ezcess hydrostatic pressure developed by the applied pressure is fully
dissipated and the primary consolidation i. complete.
2
The additional reduction in volume is called secondary consolidation
3.
It is attributed to the plastic readjustment of the solid particles and the
adsorbed water to new stress system.

au = C, 22u iz2
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 10
Answer
A. Assumptions : Following are the assumptions made in Terzaghi's one
dimensional consolidation theory :
1.
The soil mass is homogeneous and fully saturated
2.
The soil particles and water are incompressible.
3.
Darcy's law for flow of water through soil mass is applicable during
consolidation
Scanned with CamScanner
Geotechnical Engineering
3-13 A (CE-Sem-5)
4.
Coefficient of permeability is constant during consolidation.
5.
Load is applied in one direction only and deformation occurs only in the
direction of load applied.
6.
The deformation is entirely due to decrease in volume.
7.
The drainage of pore water occurs only in one direction.
S.
A boundary drainage face offers no resistance to flow of water from soil.
9.
During consolidation the change in thickness is continuous but final
value of compression is related to initial thickness only.
B. Derivation :
1.
Fig. 3.12.1, shows a clay layer of thickness H, sandwiched between two
layers of sand which serves as drainage faces.
2.
When the layer is subjected to a pressure increment so. excess hydrostatic
pressure is set up in the clay layer.
3.
At the time the instant of pressure application, whole of the consolidating
pressure Aa is carried by the pore water so that the initial excess
hydrostatic pressure uo is equal to so. and is represented by a straight
line u = so on the pressure distribution diagram.
4.
The distribution of excess hydrostatic pressure u at any time 't' is
indicated by the curve AFB, joining water levels, in the piezometric
tubes, this curve is known as isochrone and number of such isochrone
can be drawn at various time intervals (2. t3 etc.
5.
The slope of isochrones at any point at a given time indicates the rate of
change of u with depth.
6.
At any times "t' the hydraulic head 'h' corresponding to the excess
hydrostatic pressure is given by,
h=
u
=
(3.12.1)
7.
Hence, the hydraulic gradient 'i' is given by,
i = ah iz
(3.12.2)
8.
Thus, the rate of change of u along the depth of the layer represents
the hydraulic gradient.
9.
The velocity with which the excess pore water flows at the depth 'z' is
given by Darcy's law as :
V = ki = x z

Answer
A.
Normally Consolidated and Overconsolidnted Soil :
1.
A normally consolidated soil is one which has not been subjected. in
past, to a pressure greater than the present existing pressure.
2.
A soil is said to be overconsolidated if has been subjected in the past to
a pressure in excess of the present pressure.
3.
Normally consolidated soils and overconsolidated soils are not the
different types of soils but these only indicate the condition or state of a
soil in relation to the past and present pressures exerted on it.

The effect of Westergaard's assumption is that the concentration of
stress directly under the load is less than that given by Boussinesq but
exceeds it at some distance from the centre.
2.
Thus at r/Z = o, Westergaard's value is 67 % of Boussinesq's value, at
r/Z = 1.5. both are equal but at r/Z > 1.5, Westergaard's stresses are
greater.

There are generally thin layers of sand embedded in homogeneous
clay strata.
3.
Westergaard's solution assumes that there are thin sheets of rigid
materials sandwiched in a homogeneous soil mass.
4.
These thin sheets are closely spaced and are of infinite rigidity and are,
therefore, incompressible.
5.
These permit only downward displacement of the soil mass as a whole
without any lateral displacement.
6.
Therefore, Westergaard's solution represents more closely the actual
sedimentary deposits.

B.
Importance of Pressure Bulb :
1.
In his opening discussion on settlement of structures at an International
Conference held at Harvard University in 1936, Terzaghi advocated and
stressed on the importance of the pressure bulb and its relationship
with the seat of settlement.
2. As stated above, we may draw any number of isobars for any given load
(such as isobars of 0.8q, 0.6q,
0.1q), but the isobar that is of practical
significance is the one which encloses a soil mass which is responsible
for the settlement of the structure.
3.
Terzaghi recommended that for all practical purposes, such a zone may
be taken as the zone bounded by the vertical stress contour of value
0.2q.
4.
The depth where the vertical stress in the soil mass reduces to 0.2 times
the foundation contact pressure is, thus, known as the significant depth
(D,)
5.

What is Mohr's circle ? Discuss its important
characteristics.
AKTU 2017-18, Marks 02
Answer
Mohr's Circle :
1.
Mohr's circle is a graphical representation of a general state of stress at
a point.
2
It can be shown that the locus of stress coordinates (c. =) for all planes
through a point is a circle, the Mohr circle of stress.
3.
To draw a Mohr circle, the normal stress ois plotted along the X-axis and
shear is plotted along the Y-axis.
4.
This method is used for evaluation of principal stresses, maximum shear
stress, normal and tangential stresses on any given plane.
Characteristics : Following are the important characteristics of Mohr's
circle:
1.
The maximum shear stress I
is numerically equal to (G1 and it
occurs on a plane inclined at 45° to the principal planes as shown in Fig.
4.13.1.

Describe the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory.
Answer
1.
According to Mohr, the failure is caused by a critical combination of the
normal and shear stresses.
2.
When the soil sample has failed, the shear stress on the failure plane
defines the shear strength of the soil. Thus it is necessary to identify the
failure plane.
Scanned with CamScanner
Geotechnical Engineering
4-19 A (CE-Sem-5)
3.
Failure of the material occurs when the Mohr circle of the stresses
touches the Mohr envelope.
4.
At the point of contact (D) of the failure envelope on the Mohr circle, the
critical combination of shear and normal stresses is reached and the
failure occurs. The plane indicated by the line PD is, therefore, the
failure plane.
5.
Any Mohr's circle which lies below the failure envelope represents a
(non-failure) stable condition.
6.
The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion can be written as the equation for
the line that represents the failure envelope. The general equation is,
S = c + a tan

s = Shear strength on the failure plane.

Describe direct shear test. What are its merits and
demerits ?
Answer
Direct Shear Test :
1.
A direct shear test is a laboratory or field test used by geotechnical
engineers to measure the shear strength properties of soil or rock
material.
2
The original form of apparatus for the direct application of shear force is
the shear box.
3.
The apparatus consists of a square brass box split horizontally at the
level of the center of the soil sample, which is held between metal grilles
and porous stones as shown in Fig. 4.15.1.
4.
Vertical load is applied to the sample as shown in the Fig. 4.15.1 and is
held constant during a test.
5.
A gradually increasing horizontal load is applied to the lower part of the
box until the sample fails in shear.
6.
The shear load at failure is divided by the eross-sectional area of the
sample to give the ultimate shearing strength.

Fig. 4.15.1. Direct shear test.
Merits : Following are the merits of direct shear test :
1.
A direct shear machine is simple and fast to operate.
2.
Direct shear requirement is much less expensive as compared to other
tests.
3.
It is easy to test sands and gravels.
4.
Large samples can be tested in large shear boxes, as small samples can
give misleading results.
Demerits : Following are the demerits of direct shear test :
1.
The distribution of normal and shear stress along the predetermined
failure plane is very complex.
2.
Drainage condition during this test cannot be controlled as the water
content of a saturated soil changes rapidly with stress.
3.
The area of the failure plane is not constant during the direct shear test.
This area will be less than the original area of the soil specimen.
4.
The soil is sheared on a predetermined horizontal plane. This forced
plane is not necessarily the weakest plane. This is the most important
limitation of the direct shear test.
5.
The effect of internal restraint by the side walls of the shear box is likely
to affect the results.
6.
The measurement of pore water pressure is not possible.

Describe the triaxial shear test. What are the advantages
of triaxial shear test over the direct shear test ?
Answer
Triaxial Compression Test :
1.
A diagrammatic layout of a triaxial test apparatus is shown in Fig. 4.16.1.
2.
In the triaxial compression test, three or more identical samples of soil
are subjected to uniformly distributed fluid pressure around the
cylindrical surface.
3.
The sample is sealed in a watertight rubber membrane.
4.
Then axial load is applied to the soil sample until it fails.

OR
Describe the unconfined compression test ? What is its advantage
over a triaxial test ?
AKTU 2019-20, Marks 07
Answer
Unconfined Compression Test :
1.
Unconfined compression or uniaxial compression test is a special case of
a triaxial test.
2.
The unconfined compression test is performed on unconfined cylindrical
specimen of a cohesive soil to measure its unconfined compression
strength.
3.
It is carried out without any confining pressure and the triaxial cell
assembly is not required, making the test procedure simpler.
4.
It is carried out on saturated clay specimens that can stand unsupported.
5.
The clay specimen is loaded axially where the load is increased to failure.
The loading is carried out quickly.

Describe the vane shear test. What are the merits and
demerits of vane shear test.
Answer
Vane Shear Test :
1.
This test provides a simple and quick method of determining the
undrained (vane) shear strength of relatively soft clays.
2.
It is a rotational shear test, in which a cylindrical volume of clay is made
to rotate by a cruciform vane pushed into the clay.
3.
The opposing shear resistance between the cylinder and the surrounding
material is determined from the torque applied to the vane, which is
measured by means of a calibrated torsion spring and hence the shear
strength of the clay can be calculated.
4.
The shear strength of the soil is determined using the formula,
T = ns[D²H/2 + D³/6]
where,
T = Applied torque.
H = Height of vane.
D = Diameter of vane.
s = Undrained shear strength.
Merits : Following are the merits of vane shear test :
1.
The test is simple and quick.
2.
It is ideally suited for the determination of the in-situ undrained shear
strength of non-fissured fully saturated clay.
3.
The test can be conveniently used to determine the sensitivity of the
soil.
Demerits : Following are the demerits of vane shear test :
1.
The test cannot be conducted on the fissured clay or the clay containing
sand or silt laminations.
2.
The test does not give accurate results when the failure envelope is not
horizontal.

Answer
Advantages : Following are the various advantages of triaxial
compression test:
1.
There is complete control over the drainage conditions. Tests can be
easily conducted for all three types of drainage conditions.
2.
Pore pressure changes and the volumetric changes can be measured
directly.
3.
The stress distribution on the failure plane is uniform.
4.
The specimen is free to fail on the weakest plane.
5.
The state of stress at all intermediate stages upto failure is known. The
Mohr circle can be drawn at any stage of shear.
6.
The test is suitable for accurate research work.
Disadvantages : Following are the disadvantages of triaxial compression
test :
1.
The apparatus is elaborate, costly and bulky.
2.
The drained test takes a longer period as compared with that in a direct
shear test.
3.
It is not possible to determine the cross-sectional area of the specimen
accurately at large strains, as the assumption that the specimen remains
cylindrical does not hold good.
4.
The test simulates only axis-symmetrical problems. In the field, the
problem is generally 3-dimensional. A general test in which all the three
stresses are varied would be more useful.
5.
The consolidation of the specimen in the test is isotropic whereas in the
field, the consolidation is generally anisotropic.
Que 4.20.
Classify shear tests based on drainage conditions.
Answer
Types of Shear Test : Depending on whether drainage is permitted
during the consolidation stage and the shear stage, the test conducted
on the saturated soils for determining the shear strength are classified
as follows :
A.
Unconsolidated Undrained Test (UU Test) :
1.
Drainage is not permitted at any stage of the test, that is, either before
the test during the application of the normal stress or during the test
when the shear stresses are applied.
2.
In this test a minimum of three soil samples are subjected to different
confining pressures O3 and then loaded to failure. The resulting Mohr's
envelope will be as shown in Fig. 4.20.1.

B. Consolidated Undrained Test (CU Test) :
1.
Drainage is permitted fully in this type of test during the application of
the normal stress and no drainage is permitted during the application of
the shear stress.
2.
In this test soil sample is initially consolidated under confining pressure.
This pressure is known as initial effective confining pressure (a, ).
3.
After consolidation, the confining pressure and pore water pressure
may be increased by the same amount thus keeping the effective stress
still constant at a This operation is called application of back pressure,
"B- Back pressure is applied in order to saturate the soil sample and to
facilitate measurement of negative pore water pressure during
application of deviatoric stress in the case of overconsolidated clays.
4.
The soil sample is sheared under this elevated cell pressure T3 and it fails
at a vertical axial stress of O1. Mohr's circles for determination of total
stress parameters are drawn with 101 up) and 1(a3 - UB) = a ) as major
and minor total principal stresses at failure, respectively. The resulting
failure envelope is shown in Fig. 4.20.2.

The soil is consolidated under the applied normal stresses and is tested
for shear by applying the shear stress also very slowly while drainage is
permitted at every stage.

stress.

Answer
A.
Skempton's Pore Pressure Parameters :
1.
Skempton introduced a simple concept to estimate the change in pore
water pressure (Au) in a soil element due to the changes in major and
minor total principle stresses (Ao, and sag) in undrained loading.
2
There are two type of pore pressure parameter B and A.
i
B = It can be defined as the ratio of change in the pore water pressure
with the change in the cell pressure.
il
A = It can be defined as the ratio of change in the pore water pressure
with the change in the deviator stress.
B.
Expression of Pore Pressure Parameters under Deviator Stress :

In an elastic material, the volumetric strain s v/ro is equal to the sum
of the linear strains in three directions, and is given by,
AVO=AG+AG+AS A Vo o =
where,
E1 = Strain in the direction-1

modified as,
&V v. = + 3 +
(4.22.5)
where C. is the coefficient of volume compressibility of the soil.
5.
Substituting the values of Ao, Aa, and Aa, form eq. (4.22.1), (4.22.2)

For a fully saturated soils, A is also equal to A, as B is unity.
The value of the pore pressure parameter A can be determined
experimentally in a triaxial test.
Que 4.23.
What is the significance of the pore pressure
coefficients ? Illustrate the answer by an example.How are the pore
pressure parameters A and B determined ?
Answer
A.
Significance:
1.
Skempton's pore pressure parameters are very useful in field problems
where pore pressures that are induced consequent to change in the
total stress may have to be computed.
2.
Pore water pressure play a very important role in determining the
shear strength of soil.
B. Example :
1.
Embankment constructed rapidly over a soft clay deposit.
2.
Large earth dam constructed rapidly with no change in water content of
soft clay.
3.

Stress Distribution in Soil & Shear Strength
Determination of parameter A and B :
1.
Parameter B can be determined in a UU test. The cell pressure is
increased by Aog and the corresponding increase in pore pressure Aut is
measured in the first stage of the triaxial test. Then, B = Aur/doj
2.
Parameter A is measured during the second stage of the triaxial test. If
is the pore pressure increase due to an increase in deviator stress of
(Ao, - Aag) with cell pressure being constant, A = Au2 (Ao, - 4o3). For
acompletely saturated soil, A = A
3.
For a fully saturated soil, parameter A can also be determined easily in
a CU test. In this test, since so3 = o when the deviator stress is applied,
A = Au / (Ao, - Ao3) = Au /so,

In a tri-axial test of soil, specimen was consolidated
under a cell pressure of 700 kN/m² and the increased pore pressure
reading was 450 kN/m². The axial load was then increased to give a
deviator stress of 570 kN/m² and pore pressure reading of 650 kN/m².
Calculate the pore pressure parameters A and B.
Answer
Given : Cell pressure = 700 kN/m², Deviator stress = 570 kN/m²
Pore pressure = 650 kN/m², Increased pore pressure = 450 kN/m²
To Find : Pore pressure parameters A and B.
Assume back pressure = 360 kN/m², increase cell pressure = 800 kN/m².

Questions-Answers
Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 5.1.
What are the different types of earth pressure ? Give
examples.
Answer
Types of Earth Pressure : Lateral earth pressure can be grouped into
three categories, depending upon the movement of the retaining wall
with respect to the soil retained :
1.
At-rest Pressure :
i.
The lateral earth pressure is called at-rest pressure when the soil mass
is not subjected to any lateral yielding or movement.
ii.
This case occurs when the retaining wall is firmly fixed at its top and is
not allowed to rotate or move laterally.
iii.
Fig. i.1.1(a) shows the basement retaining walls which are restrained
against the movement by the basement slab provided at their tops.
2.
Active Pressure :
i.
A state of active pressure occurs when the soil mass yields in such a
way that it tends to stretch horizontally.
ii.
A retaining wall when moves away from the backfill, there is a stretching
of the soil mass and the active state of earth pressure exists.
iii.
In Fig. 5.1.1(b), the active pressure develops on the right-hand side
when the wall moves towards left.
3.
Passive Pressure :
i.
A state of passive pressure exists when the movement of the wall is
such that the soil tends to compress horizontally.
üi.
In Fig. 5.1.1(b), the passive pressure develops on the left-side of the wall
below the ground level, as the soil in this zone is compressed when the
movement of the wall is towards right.

What are the various assumptions in Coulomb's
theory ? Also, explain Coulomb's wedge theory.
Answer
A Assumptions = Following are the basic assumptions of the Coulomb's
theory or wedge theory :
L
The backfill is dry and cohesionless.
2 Soil is homogenous, isotropic, and semi-infinite.
3
The back of the wall in contact with the backfill may be inclined or
vertical and is rough.
4.
The failure wedge acts as rigid body and stresses are uniformly
distributed over it.
5 Failure is two dimensional and rupture surface is plane which passes
through the heel of the wall.
6. Location and direction of resultant thrust is known.
B. Coulomb's Wedge Theory :
L
Couloinb developed a method for the determnination of the earth pressure
in which he considered the equilibrium of the sliding wedge which is
formed when the movennent of the retaining wall takes place.
2
In the active case, the sliding wedge moves downward and outward
relative to the backfill, whereas in the passive case, the sliding wedge
moves upwards.
3. The lateral pressure on the wall is equal and opposite to the reactive
force exerted by the wall in order to keep the sliding wedge in equilibrium.
4.
In Coulomb's theory, a plane failure surface is assumed and the lateral
force required to maintain the equilibrium of the wedge is found using
the principles of staties.
Scanned with CamScanner
Geotechnical Engineering
5-9 (CE-Sem-5)
5.
The procedure is repeated on several trial surfaces.
6.
The trial surface which gives the largest force for the active case, and
the smallest force for the passive case, is the actual failure surface.
7.
The Coulomb's theory is more general than the Rankine's theory.
Que 5.6.
Discuss Coulomb's method for determimation of passive
earth pressure for cohesionless soils.
Answer
1.
The failure surface in Coulomb's passive state is assumed to be a plane.
2
In this case, the failure wedge moves upward.
3.
The direction of R and P. which oppose the movement are also shown in
Fig. 5.6.1(b).
4.
The reaction R acts at d to the normal in the downward direction and
the reaction pressure P, acts at an angle to the normal in the downward
direction
5.
The value of Pp is determined from triangle shown in the Fig. 5.6.1(b).
6.
The procedure is repeated after assuming a new trial failure surface.
7.
The minimum value of P, is the Coulomb passive pressure.
8.
Coulomb passive pressure is given by,
P, =
sin²
where,
Kp=
sin
sin (6' + 8) sin ($'+i)
sin +8) sin ( + i)
9.
The resultant passive pressure P. acts at a height of Z/3 measured from
the bottom of the wall and would be inclined at angle BS to the normal, as
shown in Fig. 5.6.1(a).
10. However, when the retaining wall moves up relative to the soil, the
friction angle 0 is measured below the normal and 5 is said to be negative.
11. The negative wall friction produces a value of passive pressure lower
than that for the usual positive wall friction.

Rehbann's construction becomes inconvenient when the slope angle i
approaches the angle 6. Culmann developed a method which is more
general than Rehbann's method.
2
Culmann's method is convenient for determining the active earth
pressure for soils having no cohesion. Most backfills, in practice, fall into
this category.
3.
The method can be used for backfill surfaces of any shape, different
types of surcharge loads and even for layered backfill.
The Procedure Consists of the Following Steps :
1.
Draw the retaining wall AB to the scale.
2
Draw the <-line BD.
3.
A line BL is drawn at an angle V with line BD, such that V = a - 8.
4.
A failure surface BF is assumed, and the weight (W) of failure wedge
ABF is computed
5.
The weight (W) is plotted along BD such that BP = W.
6.
A line PQ is drawn from point P parallel to BL to intersect the surface BF
at Q.
7.
The length PQ represents the magnitude of P. required to maintain
equilibrium for assumed failure plane.
8.
Several other failure planes BF2, BF1, BF3 etc., are assumed and the
procedure is repeated. Thus, the point Q2, Q1. Q3, etc., are obtained.

Explain the types of slopes of earth surface.
Answer
Types of slopes :
A.
On the basis of method of construction:
1.
Natural Slopes :
i
The slopes formed due to natural process and exist naturally are called
natural slopes.
il
Natural slopes are those that exist in nature and are formed by natural
causes. Such slopes exist in hilly areas.
2
Artificial Slopes :
i
The slopes formed by unnatural process. Artificial slopes are formed by
humans as per requirements.
il
The sides of cuttings. the slopes of embankments constructed for roads,
railway lines, canals etc., and the slopes of earth dams constructed for
storing water are examples of manmade slopes.
B. On the Basis of Type of Soil :
1.
Cohesive Soil Slope : Having purely cohesive soil as its content. It is
also known as cohesive soil slope.
2
Frictional Soil Slope : Slopes having frictional soil as its contents. It is
also known as frictional soil slope.
3.
Cohesive-Frictional Soil Slope : Slopes made up of soil which has
both frictional as well as cohesive properties. It is also known as c-0 soil
slope.
Que 5.11.
What are the assumptions made in slope stability
analysis ?
Answer
Assumptions made in Slope Stability Analysis :
1.
The problem is treated as two dimensional, i.e., no shear stresses are
assumed to be existing across the plane of cross-section of the
embankment.
2.
The shear strength of the soil is known, and can be expressed in terms
of Coulomb's law; i.e.,
=
Scanned with CamScanner
(CE-Sem-5)
Earth Pressure and Stability of Slopes
where, c and & represent the average effective values of cohesion and
angle of friction, respectively, of the homogeneous embanked soil.
1
When different soils are used in the construction of the ernhankment,
such as in a non-homogeneous zoned embankment, the material in
each zone is represented by a different Coulomb's equation for shear
strength, using C and t values of the respective zone.
4
If any water is seeping through the embankment, causing additional
disturbing forces, then it is assumed that the flownet for the seepage is
already known, so that the seepage stresses can be evaluated.
With these assumptions, we can analysis and examine the stability of
earthen slopes with a fair degree of accuracy.
Que 5.12.
What do you mean by finite slope ? Derive the expression
for factor of safety and shear strength during the stability analysis.
Answer
A Finite Slopes :
L Afinite slope is one with a base and top surface, the height being limited.
The inclined faces of earth dams, embankments and excavation and the
like are all finite slopes.
2
These slopes are bounded by top and bottom surface.
3 Failure of finite slopes takes place due to rotation.
B. Factor of Safety =

S = c + G tan
where,
c = Cohesion.
$ = Angle of internal friction.
a = Normal stress on the potential failure surface.
Similarly, the mobilized shear strength is given by,

Answer
Following are the three different factors of safety :
1.
Factor of Safety with respect to Shear Strength :
The factor of safety is defined as the ratio of the shear strength to the
shear stress along the surface of failure.
Thus
F. , = s S
-
where,
F. = Factor of safety with respect to shear strength.
s = Shear strength.
Im = Mobilized shear stress (equal to applied shear
stress).
2
Factor of Safety with respect to Cohesion : The factor of safety
with respect to cohesion (F2 is the ratio of the available cohesion intercept
(c) and the mobilized cohesion intercept (c,,,).
F, c = e c
where,
c = Cohesion intercept.
Cm = Mobilized cohesion intercept.
F. = Factor of safety with respect to cohesion.
3.
Factor of Safety with respect to Friction : The factor of safety with
respect to friction is the ratio of the available frictional strength to the
mobilized fractional strength. Thus
= tan tan
where,
F. = Factor of safety with respect to friction.
0 = Angle of shearing resistance.

In this method, the soil mass above the assumed slip eircle is divided into
a number of vertical slices of equal width, as shown in Fig. 5.17.1. The
number of slices may vary from 6 to 12, when hand computations are to
be used.

2. In the conventional method, the forces between the slices are neglected
and each slice is considered to be an independent column of soil of unit
thickness.
3.
If slice number 4 is taken as a typical slice, the weight of the slice Wi is
calculated as equal to yhb.
where,
Y = Bulk unit weight of the soil.
h = Height of the slice.
b = Width of slice.
4. The line of action which can be taken to pass through the mid-width
point of the slice, meets the base of the slice of length / at P.
5.
The weight W is plotted as a vector PQ and then resolved into its normal
and tangential components N and T, respectively, at P.
6.
Since the normal component N passes through P and the centre of
rotation O. it does not have a driving moment, but mobilize frictional
resistance along the slip surface.
7.
The tangential component T causes the rotating moment. In the end
slice, such as slice number 1 in Fig. 5.17.1, the tangential component
may act in an opposite direction, causing a restoring moment.
8.
T is taken as positive when causing a driving moment and negative
when causing a resisting moment.
9.
The algebraic sum of T will always be positive and contribute to the
driving moment.
10. Considering the whole slip surface AB of length L. the total driving and
resisting forces are :

form

Describe the Bishop's method for slope analysis.
Answer
Bishop's Method :
1.
Equation developed based on Bishop's analysis of slopes, contains the
term pore pressure u. The Bishop and Morgenstern method proposes
the following equation for the evaluation of u
ru = u / yh
(5.21.1)
Where,
u = Pore water pressure at any point on the assumed
failure surface.
Y = Unit weight of the soil.
h = The depth of the point in the soil mass below
the ground surface.
2.
The pore pressure ratio T is assumed to be constant throughout the
cross-section, which is called a homogeneous pore pressure distribution.

limit and shrinkage limits are known as Atterberg limits. The water
content at which the soil behaviour changes from the liquid to the
plastic state is called the liquid limit; from the plastic to the semi-
solid state is the plastic limit; and from the semi-solid to the solid
state is the shrinkage limit.
