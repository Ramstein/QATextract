Que 1.1.
Define the term 'Structure'. Also discuss the structural
elements.
Answer
A. Structure :
1.
A structure is a system of connected parts used to support a load.
Examples of structures in civil engineering are buildings, bridges and
towers.
2.
While designing a structure the engineer must account for its safety,
aesthetic and serviceability also taking into consideration economic
and environmental constraints.
B. Structural Elements : The common structural elements are as
follows :
1. Tie rods
2. Beams
3. Columns
1.
Tie Rods (or Bracing Struts) : Tie rods or bracing struts are the
structural members subjected to tensile force. Tie rods are slender and
are often chosen from rods, bars, angles or channels.

Answer
Classification of Structures : These can be classified as follows :
1.
On the Basis of Structural Forms and Shapes :
i.
Linear forms (Skeletal structures).
ii.
Curvilinear forms (Surface structures).
i.
Linear Forms :

They are articulated structures assembled with parts consisting of
linear elements, such as bars and beams, the connection between
them being bolted or riveted or welded.
b.
Linear forms are preferred for residential, official, and educational
purposes. The linear form is called skeletal structures.

On the Basis of Dominant Stress Conditions :
i
Uniform stress forms.
ii.
Varying stress forms.
i.
Uniform Stress Forms : When the stress across a section is uniform
over the depth of a member or over the thickness of a panel, such a form
is called uniform stress form.
Example : Cables, arches, truss member, shells etc.
ii. Varying Stress Forms : When the stress varies over the depth or
thickness, from a maximum compressive stress on one surface to a
maximum tensile stress on the other, such a form is called varying
stress form.
Example : Beams, rigid frames, slabs, plates etc.

i.
Beams and Trusses :
a.
Beams and trusses are a form of structures.
b.
A simply supported beam, supported on a pin at one end and a roller
at the other end is quite stable and statically determinate, and
transmits the external loads to the supports mainly through shear
and moment.
c.
Some typically complex types of beams are fixed end beams and
continuous beams. These beams are statically indeterminate and
cannot be solved using equations of static equilibrium alone.

consequently cable takes a form of defined sag.
d.
Cables are commonly used to support bridges and building roofs.
e.
Arches are characterized by high axial thrust and relatively low
bending moment which result from its distinguished shape as well
as the horizontal reactions that developed at the support points.
f.
Arches achieve their strength in compression. Arches must be rigid
in order to maintain its shape.
g.
Arches are used in bridge structures, dome roofs etc.

What do you understand by the term structural load ?
Explain different types of loads.
Answer
A. Structural Load : Structural load is consists of following loads :
1.
Dead Loads :
i.
Dead loads are fixed to the structure and is mostly invariant with time.
Example : Self weight of the structure, furniture, etc.
ii.
Dead loads reside permanently in the structure and are the basic
parameter for design in all structural systems.
2
Live Loads : Live loads are the loads which are variable in nature, both in
the time and magnitude. These loads are applied over and above the dead or
fixed loads. They are generally known as imposed loads.
3.
Environmental Loads :
i.
These loads are due to wind, earthquake, floods, landslides etc., and
caused by natural phenomenon.
ii.
These loads are mostly non deterministic because of uncertainties
associated with their occurrence, time and magnitude and terrestrial
conditions.
4.
Man-made Loads: Man-made loads are caused by human activities. These
loads are like impact loads, blast loads, dynamic loads etc.
B.
Types of Loads :
1.
Classification of Loads on the Basis of Direction in which Loads
are Acting :
i.
Gravity Loads : Gravity loads are the dead loads, live loads, snow and
ice loads because they always act vertically downwards.
ii.
Lateral Loads : The loads which act horizontally as wind loads,
earthquake loads and soil and hydrostatic pressures are known as
lateral loads.
iii. Directionless loads : Thermal loads, loads due to misfit and blasting
loads are known as directionless loads.
2.
Classification of Loads on the Basis of Their Variation with
Time :
i.
Static or Monotonic Loads : Loads that do not vary with time and always
act in the same sense are known as monotonic or static load. Example : dead
loads, construction loads, snow loads and earth pressure etc.
ii.
Cyclic or Dynamic Loads :
a.
Loads that vary with time and change their sense are known as cyclic
or dynamic loads.
b.
Example : earthquake loads, impact loads, blast loads and machine
induced loads. Dynamic load sets the structure to vibrate.

What do you mean by degree of freedom ? Also explain
the kinematic indeterminacy.
AKTU 2012-13, Marks 05
OR
What do you understand by kinematic indeterminacy of
structures ? Explain in sufficient detail.
AKTU 2013-14, Marks 05
Answer
A.
Degree of Freedom :
1.
When a structure composed of several members which are subjected to
loads, the joints undergo displacements in the form of rotation and
translation.
2.
The number of independent joint displacement is called the degree of
kinematic indeterminacy or the number of degree of freedom.
B.
Kinematic Indeterminacy :
1.
Degree of kinematic indeterminacy or number of degree of freedom is
the sum of degree of freedom in rotation and translation.
2.
A joint in space can have six possible movements (3 linear displacements,
one along each reference axis and 3 rotations, one about each reference
axis) hence it has six degree of freedom.
3.
In case of a two dimensional system, a free joint has three degree of
freedom [Two translation and one rotation] hence in case of two
dimensional system any joint may have maximum of 3 degree of kinematic
indeterminacy.
4.
The total kinematic indeterminacy of a structure represents the sum of
all the possible displacement that various joints of the structure can
undergo.

giving at least two examples with reference to trusses.
OR
What do you mean by static indeterminacy Explain with examples.
AKTU 2012-13, Marks 05
Answer
A.
Static Indeterminacy : For a structure, if available equilibrium
equations are less than the unknown forces then structure is known as
statically indeterminate structure.
1.
For a coplanar rigid frame structure if :
i
3m
=
3j
r
Structure is statically determinate.
is
3m
V
3j
-
r
Structure is statically indeterminate.
where,
m = Number of members in a structure.
r = Total number of forces and moment reaction
components.
2
Static indeterminacy = 3m. - (3j r)
3.
Degree of static indeterminacy for truss = Total number of unknowns
(external and internal) forces - Number of independent equations of
equilibrium.
If,
j = Number of pin (hinge) joints connecting these
members.
i
Total number of unknown forces = (m + r)
il.
Total number of independent equilibrium equations = 2j
in
Degree of static indeterminacy = (m + r) 2j
B.
Examples :
1
For the truss as shown in Fig. 1.7.1, we have
m = 18, i = 10, and r = 3.
Fig. 1.7.1. Indeterminate truss.
Degree of static indeterminacy = (m + r) 2j
= (18 + 3) - 2 x 10
= 21 - 20 = 1
So, degree of static indeterminacy = 1.
2.
For the truss as shown in the Fig. 1.7.2, we have
m = 17, , j = 10, and r = 4.
Fig. 1.7.2. (Externally) indeterminate truss.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-12 C (CE-Sem-4)
Classification of Structures
Degree of static indeterminacy = (m + r) - 2j
= (17 + 4) - 2 x 10
= 21-20=1 -
So, degree of static indeterminacy = 1.
Que 1.8.
Explain external and internal indeterminacy of
structure.
Answer
A.
External Indeterminacy of Structure (I.) :
1.
Let r be the total number of external reaction components at supports
and e be the total number of equations of statical equilibrium available
for the given structure then there may arise three different cases.
i.
r = e
Structure is externally determinate.
ii.
T V e
Structure is externally indeterminate.
iii.
r<e
Structure is externally unstable.
Thus external indeterminacy 1e = e.
B.
Internal Indeterminacy of Structure (I¿) :
i.
It is defined in terms of the internal member forces that can not be
determined from simple statical relations if the structure is taken as
externally determinate.
ii.
This type of internal indeterminacy is seen in articulated (pin joined
frames) and rigid frame structure.
iii.
In case of beams it is equal to zero.
1.
Articulated Structures :
i.
If a truss consist of m number of pin connected members (it means the
truss is having m number of unknown member forces) through 'j
number of joints in the truss where 'T' number of external support
reactions are developed and 'e' number of equation of statical
equilibrium are available then,
ii.
Total number of equations of equilibrium available at joints.
e = 2j
(... o, V=0]
iii. Total number of unknown = Internal member forces + Reaction
at
supports
= m + r
iv.
Then for determinacy of the truss, m + r = 2j or m = 2j -
r
v.
In case of externally determinate 2-Dimensional plane truss
r = 3
(r = e = 3)
hence
m = 2j - 3
Total indeterminacy, 1, = m - [2j-r] -
vi. For externally determinate 3 dimensional truss
m = 3j - r (at each joint, equations available=3j)
m = 3j - 6
Scanned with CamScanner
Structural Analysis
1-13 C (CE-Sem-4)
vii. Now in case of 2-D trusses :
then the truss has additional member and it is
known as redundant truss.
m =2j-3,
the truss is internally determinate and is
a
perfect truss.
m<2j-3,
the truss is imperfect truss, it has deficiency of
members and its configuration is unstable
under certain loading condition.
Degree of internal indeterminacy, I, = m - (2j - 3)
vin. In case of 3-D space trusses :
If. m = 3j - 6,
Internally determinate space truss
m > 3j - 6.
Internally indeterminate space truss
m < 3j - 6,
Internally unstable truss
Degree of internal indeterminacy, I, = m - (3j - r) = m - (3j - 6),
2
Rigid Frames :
i
These frames have rigid joint and may be a 2-dimensional or 3-
dimensional figure. In a member of rigid frame there exist 3 stress
resultants or member forces which need to be determined.
Hence, total number of unknown = (3m + r).
ii.
Since at each joint of rigid frame three equations of equilibrium are
available then,
Total number of equations of equilibrium = 3j
Then for a frame to be internally determinate, 3j = 3m + r
iii.
If 3m V 3j - r, the frame becomes internally indeterminate.
If 3m < 3j - r, the frame becomes internally unstable or deficient.
I, = 3m - (3j - r) = 3m - (3j - 3) for 2D frame.
iv.
Similarly in case of 3 dimensional frame total number of unknown
becomes (6m +r) and a total of 6j equations of equilibrium are available
for analysis.
v.
Then the frame will be internally determinate,
if
6j = €m + r
-
and if 6m V 6j-r,
the frame becomes internally indeterminate
and when 6m < 6j r,
the frame becomes internally unstable.
= 6m (6j - r) = 6m - (6j-6) - for 3D frame
C.
Total Indeterminacy of Rigid Frame Structure (I,) :
1. A structure may be indeterminate internally or externally or both in
terms of member forces or external reactions.
2.
Hence, the total indeterminacy of a structure is the sum of internal and
external indeterminacy,
i.e.,
I,=1,+1,
I = (3m - (3j - r) for 2 dimensional frame.
1, = 16m - (6j - r) for 3 dimensional frame.

Answer

Analysis of Truss

Roof Trusses:
Reef
Purlins
Tap enrd
Guscet
plates
Bottom cord
Knee brace
Span
Bay
Fig. 2.2.1. Roof truss.
1.
Roof trusses are often used as part of an industrial building frame, as
shown in Fig. 2.2.1. Here. the roofload is transmitted to the truss at the
joints by means of a series of purlins.
2
The rooftruss along with its supporting columns is called as bent.
3.
Ordinarily, roof trusses are supported either by columns of wood, steel,
or reinforced concrete. or by masonry walls.
4.
To keep the bent rigid. and thereby capable of resisting horizontal wind
forces. knee braces are sometimes used at the supporting columns.
5.
The space between adjacent bents is called a bay. Bays are economically
spaced at about 4.6 m for spans around 18 m and about 6.1 m for spans
of 30 m.
6.
Bays are often tied together using diagonal bracing in order to maintain
rigidity of the building's structure.
7.
Trusses used to support roofs are selected on the basis of the span, the
slope, and the roof material.
8.
Some common types of trusses are scissors truss, the Howe and Pratt
truss, Fan truss or Fink truss, Warren truss, Sawtooth truss, Bowsting
truss etc.
B. Bridge Trusses :
1.
The main structural elements of a typical bridge truss are shown in Fig.
2.2.2 Here it is seen that a load on the deck is first transmitted to
stringers, then to floor beams, and finally to the joints of the two supporting
side trusses.
2
The top and bottom cords of these side trusses are connected by top and
bottom lateral bracing, which serves to resist the lateral forces caused
by wind and the sideway caused by moving vehicles on the bridge.
3.
Additional stability is provided by the portal and sway bracing.
4.
As
in the case of many long-span trusses, a roller is provided at one end
of a bridge truss to allow for thermal expansion.
5.
A few of the typical forms of bridge truss: Pratt, Howe and Warren
trunses are normally used for spans up to 61 in in length.
6.
For larger spans, a truss with a polygonal upper cord, such as the Parker
truss, is used for some savings in material.
Scanned with CamScanner
Structural Analysis
25C (CE-Sem-4)
7.
The greatest economy of material is obtained if the diagonals have a
slope between 45° and 60 with the horizontal.
8.
If this rule is maintained. then for spans greater than 91 m. the depth of
the truss must increase and consequently the panels will zet longer
10. This result in a heavy deck system and. to keep the weight of the deck
within tolerable limits, subdivided trusses has been developed.

What are different methods of analysis of trusses ?
Explain any one in detail.
OR
What are the methods available for the analysis of trusses Explain.
AKTU 2013-14, Marks 05
Answer
Different Methods of Analysis of Trusses : To analyze a statically
determinate truss we have following two methods :
1.
Method of joints.
2.
Method of sections.
1.
Method of Joints :
i.
In method of joints, the principle used is, if a truss is in equilibrium, then
each of its joint must also be in equilibrium.
ii.
Joint analysis should start at a joint having atleast one known force and
atmost two unknown forces.
iii. If a force is pushing on the pin, member will be in compression and vice-
versa.
iv.
During solution of a truss always assume the unknown member force
acting on the joint's free body diagram to be in tension.
v.
Ifour assumption is correct then solutioni will be positive for the member.
vi.
Now use the correct magnitude and direction of force on subsequent
joint's froe body diagram.

whether it 18 atable or unstable.
2.
Remember that, bowever if n truss in unstable, it does not matter
whether it in statically determinate or indeterminate. The use of an
unstable truam la alwaya avoided.
Que 2.5.
Explain the concept of Zero-Force Members in a truss.
Answer
Concept of Zero-Force Member :
1.
The member that aupports no loading are termed an tero-force membera
2.
Zero force members are uned to simplify the truma analysia using the
method of joints.
3.
Zero force members are necesaary for the atability of the truma during
4.
Zero force members are uned to provide support is the applied loading
la changed
5.
Zero force members occur in following two canca
i.
If no eaternal load la acting at a joint and the membera joined at this
joint are at any angle o then force in both of the members munt be
in order to maintain equilibrium

2-6C (CE-Sem-4)
Analysis of Trusses
Procedure to Analyze :
i.
First calculate the external support reactions by drawing the free body
diagram of the entire truss.
ii.
Draw free body diagram of a joint having at least one known force and
atmost two unknown forces.
iii.
Assume the unknown member force as tensile in nature i.e., force is
pulling the joint.
iv.
Now orientation of X and Y axes are to made such that forces on the
free body diagram can be easily resolved into their x and y components.
V.
Apply two force equilibrium equations CF, = o and >F, = o. Solve these
two equations to get unknown member force and then verify their
correct directional sense.
vi.
Continue to analyze each of the other joints, where again it is necessary
to choose a joint having atleast one known force and atmost two
unknown forces.
2.
Method of Sections :
i.
If the forces in only a few members of a truss are to be found, then the
method of sections generally used to obtain these forces.
ii.
The method of section involves passing an imaginary section through
the truss, thus cutting it into two parts.
iii.
Each of the two parts must also be in equilibrium.
iv.
Try to select the isolated portion of the truss have not more than three
unknown force members.
v.
Since only three independent equilibrium equations are present as :
EF, = o, CF, = o and >M = o.
Procedure to Analyze :
i.
Firstly cut or choose a section of truss where forces are to be determined.
ii.
Selecting the section, it may first be necessary to determine the truss's
external reactions.
iii.
Draw the free body diagrams of the selected or sectioned truss having
the least number of forces on it.
iv.
Let the member force as tensile in nature, i.e., pulling on the member joint pin.
v.
Take summation of the moment about a point that lies at the intersection
of the lines of action of two unknown forces.
vi.
If two of the unknown forces are parallel, forces may be summed
perpendicular to the direction of these unknowns to determine directly
the third unknown force.

1. Internal stability of a truss can be checked by inspection of the
arrangement of its members.
2.
If each joint is held fixed so that it cannot move in a rigid body sense
with respect to the other joints, then the truss will be stable.

3.
A simple truss will always be internally stable.
4.
If a truss is constructed so that it does not hold its joints in a fixed
position, it will be unstable or have a critical form.

Fig. 2.4.1(a) is internally stable. In Fig. 2.4.1(b) no fixity is provided
between joints B and F or G and C, so the truss will collapse under load.
B.
Internal Stability of a Compound Truss :
1.
For checking the internal stability of a compound truss we need to
identify the way in which the simple trusses are connected together.
2.
In Fig. 2.4.2, when an external load is applied to joint D. E or F can
cause the truss DEF to rotate slightly i.e., internally unstable.

C. Internal Stability of a Complex Truss :
1.
It may not be possible to tell about internal stability of a complex truss
whether it is stable or unstable.
2.
Remember that, however if a truss is unstable, it does not matter
whether it is statically determinate or indeterminate. The use of an
unstable truss is always avoided.
Que 2.5.
Explain the concept of Zero-Force Members in a truss.
Answer
Concept of Zero-Force Member :
1.
The member that supports no loading are termed as zero-force members.
2.
Zero force members are used to simplify the truss analysis using the
method of joints.
3.
Zero force members are necessary for the stability of the truss during
construction.
4.
Zero force members are used to provide support if the applied loading
is changed.
5.
Zero force members occur in following two cases :
i.
If
no external load is acting at a joint and the members joined at this
joint are at any angle e then force in both of the members must be zero
in order to maintain equilibrium.

If no external force is acting on a joint having three members for
which two of the members are collinear, the third member is a zero
force member
Here F3 = o. as no force is acting in y-direction to balance it.

2.
This precludes the use of the method of sections or the method of
resolution at the nodes as a means of determining the forces in the
truss.
3.
The technique consists of removing one of the existing members at a
node so that only two members with unknown forces remain and
substituting another member so as to maintain the truss in stable
equilibrium.
4.
The forces in member 4-5 and 5-9 are obtained by resolution of forces at
node 5. However, at nodes 4 and 9, three unknown member forces
remain, and these cannot be determined by resolution or by the method
of sections.
5.
As shown in Fig. 2.12.1(ii), member 3-9 is removed, leaving only two
unknown forces at node 9, which may be determined.
6.
To maintain stable equilibrium, a substitute member 3-8 is added to
create a modified truss, and the original applied loads are applied to the
modified truss.
7.
The forces P in all the remaining members of the modified truss may
now be determined. The force in member 3-8 is P' 3-8
8.
The applied loads are now removed, and unit virtual loads are applied to
the modified truss along the line of action of the original member 3-9, as
shown in Fig. 2.12. 1(iii).
9.
The forces u in the modified truss is determined; the force in member
3-8 is -

10. Multiplying, the forces in system (iii) by P38/128 and adding them to the
forces in system (ii) gives the force in member 8 as :
=
11. In fact, the substitute member 3-8 has been eliminated from the truss.
Hence, by applying the principle of superposition, the final forces in the
original truss are obtained from the expression :
=
where, tensile forces are positive and compressive forces are negative.
12. The final force in member 3-8 is :

Answer
1.
The modified truss shown in Fig. 2.13.2 is created by removing member
3-9, adding the substitute member 3-8, and applying the 20 kN load.
2.
The member forces in the modified truss may now be determined; the
values obtained are :
P:- = 7.51 kN (Tension)
PA-, = - 13.89 kN (Compression)
P.j = 21.54 kN (Tension)
3.
The 20 kN load is removed from the modified truss, and unit virtual
loads are applied at nodes 3 and 9 in the direction of the line of action of
the force in member 3-9.

6.
The final member forces in the original truss are :
P4.9 = 7.51 + 11.16 (-0.81)
= - 1.53 kN (Compression)
P8.9  = - 13.98 + 11.16 (-0.50)

In Fig. 3.3. l(c) beam AB carries a load W at point C. Let the deflection

point D is S2 then according to law of reciprocal deflections or Maxwell's
reciprocal deflection theorem we have

Let initially a load W is acting at a point C and deflects the beam AB by
deflection 1 under the load W.

Work done on the structure - = x
3.
Let an another equal load W is acting at point D. Due to this load there
will be further deflections of & and & at C and D.

Considering an elastic system subjected to a set of P(P1. P2. P. P,)
forces. which produce displacements, 4. A. d3 An respectively in the
direction of the respective loads at their points of applications.
2
Then the strain energy of the system will be
U = or =

3.
If one of the displacement A is increases by 54, in the direction of P,
keeping all other displacements unchanged then the incremental strain
energy of the system will be

Since the other displacement were kept unchanged hence

Describe the unit load method for calculating deflection

Answer
Unit Load Method :
1.
Consider the body shown in Fig. 3.9.1(a) which is subjected to forces P1,
P2,P3, P,
P, n applied gradually.
2.
Let displacement under load at points be A1. A2. A3 An. and at point C
be A. Then,
External work + + n -
and strain energy stored = st oe du
where a is stress and e is the strain in the element considered.
2 + 1 2 + + 2 = oe du
(3.9.1)
4.
Now, consider the same body subjected to unit load applied gradually at
C when it is free of system of P forces.
5.
Let the displacement at 1, 2, 3, n be 5,, 82, 83, &, respectively and the
displacement at C be 8. Let the stress produced in the element be p' and
the strain be e'.

PART-4
Calculation of Deflection by Conjugate Beam Method
for Statically Determinate Beam, Trusses and Frame.
CONCEPT OUTLINE : PART-4
Conjugate Beam : Conjugate beam is an imaginary beam of same
span as the original beam loaded with
El
diagram of the original
beam. such that the shear force and bending moment at a section will
represent the rotation and deflection at the section in the original
beam.
Theorem of Conjugate Beam Method :
Theorem 1 : The slope at any section of the given beam is equal to
the shear force at the corresponding section of the conjugate beam.
Theorem 2 : The deflection at any section of the given beam is equal
to the bending moment at the corresponding section of the conjugate
beam.

Therefore, ac in the given beam is equal to the shear force in the beam

Similarly. it can be observed that the deflection of C, given by eq
(3.14.1.), is equal to the bending moment in the imaginary beam loaded
M
with
El
diagram.
S.
The imaginary beam is called the conjugate beam and from the above
discussion the following two theorems result :
Theorem 1 : The rotation at a point in a beam is equal to the shear
force in the conjugate beam.
Theorem 2: : The deflection in a beam is equal to the bending moment
in the conjugate beam.

Rolling Loads and Influence Line Diagram for Beams and Trusses.
cCEPT OUTLINE : PART- 1
Rolling Loads : In actual practice, we often encounter with the
loads which are moving or with positions that are liable to change.
ILD : Influence line diagram for a stress resultant is the one
in
which ordinate represent the value of the stress resultant for the
position of unit load at the corresponding abscissa. ILD are used to
identify the position of moving loads for maximum value of stress
resultant and for finding its maximum value.

Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 4.1.
What do you understand by the term rolling loads ?
Answer
1.
Rolling Loads (or Moving Loads) : In actual practice, we often
encounter with the loads which are moving or with positions that are
liable to change.
2.
Example : Axle loads of moving trucks or vehicles, wheel loads of a
railway train or wheel loads of a gantry assembly on a gantry girder
etc.
3.
In case of rolling or moving loads it is necessary to determine the
maximum shear force and bending moment at different sections as
the loads traverse from one end to the other.
Que 4.2.
Define influence line diagram. What are the advantages
of influence line and uses of it.
Answer
A.
Influence Line Diagram :
1.
Acurve or graph that represents the function like a reaction at support,
the shear force at a section, the bending moment at a section of a
structure etc., for various positions of a unit load on the span of the
structure is called an influence line diagram for the function
represented.

ther apan
C. Uses of Influence Lines: Following are the uses of influence lines
1
Influence lines are used to show the variation of shear force and
bending moment in the member which is subjected to a live load or
moving load
2
Influence lanes help to tell where the moving load should be placed on
the structure so that it creates the greatest influence at the specified
pount
3
Useng the erdinates of influence line diagram. the magnitude of
assocuated reaction. shear. moment or deflection at the point can be
calculated
4
Influence lines are used to design the structures on which the loads
meve across the span. The common types of structures are design of
bridges industrial crane rails and conveyors etc.

From ILD for shear force at C, it is clear that maximum shear force will
develop when the head of the load reaches the section.
4.
For maximum positive shear force the tail of the UDL should reach the
section.
5.
Maximum bending moment will develop at C when the load is partly to
the left of the section and partly to the right of section.

Que 4.13.
How can you calculate the absolute SF and absolute
BM for different load condition on a simply supported beam ?
Answer
A. Absolute Maximum SF and BM for Single Concentrated Load :
1.
For achieving this, ordinate of ILD should be maximum (Refer
Fig. 4.4.2). Negative SF ordinate is maximum when N = L and is equal
to 1.

4-20 C (CE-Sem-4)
Rolling Load & Influence Line Diagrams
2.
Therefore, absolute maximum negative SF = W and it occurs when the
load is at z = L, i.e., at B.
3.
Ordinate of ILD for moment is maximum when z = to Hence, when a
L
2
load is at mid-span, absolute maximum moment occurs and its value is
WL
B.
Absolute Maximum SF and BM for UDL (Longer than Span) :
1.
Negative SF is maximum when Z = L, i.e., at B when the load occupies
entire span AB (Refer Fig. 4.4.2).
Absolute maximum SF = w x _x1xL=2wL 2
2.

C. Position for Absolute Maximum Moment in Case of UDL

Now,
Yc =
2.
For Yc to be maximum,
dz
or
z = to L 2
i.e., Absolute maximum moment occurs at mid-span.
3.
The position of the load is to be such that the section divides the load in
the same ratio as it divides the span which means that absolute
maximum moment CG of the load will be at the mid-span.

wheel load occurs when this wheel load and the centre of gravity of the
total wheel system are equidistance from the end of the beam.

3.
Fixed arch (hingeless arch).
Linear Arch : Linear arch or theoretical arch or line of thrust is a
funicular polygon structure of a two hinged or three hinged arch. It
is assumed to be pin jointed at the point of action of the load.
Eddy's Theorem : The Eddy's theorem is stated as "The bending
moment at any point on the arch axis is proportional to the vertical
intercept between the theoretical arch and the axis of the actual
arch".
Questions-Answers
Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 5.1.
Define arch. Give the classification of arches.
Answer
A. Arches :
1. Arches are used to reduce the bending moments in long span structures.
2.
An arch acts as an inverted cable, so it receives its load mainly in
compression.
3.
As arches are rigid hence they must also resist some bending and shear
depending upon how it is loaded and shaped.
4.
To describe an arch following nomenclature are used :
i.
Abutment.
ii.
Spring line.
iii.
Extrados (or back).
iv.
Intrados (or soffit).
v.
Crown.
vi.

Fig. 5.1.1
Some common type of arches are as follows
:
5.
i.
Funicular Arch : If the arch of parabolic shape and subjected to a
uniformly horizontally distributed vertical load then only compressive
forces will be resisted by the arch. This type of arch shape is called as
funicular arch because no bending or shear forces occur within the
arch.
ii.
Fixed Arch :
a.
A fixed arch must have solid foundation abutments since it is
indeterminate to the third degree, and consequently, additional stresses
can be introduced into the arch due to relative settlement of its supports
b.
Fixed arch is often made from reinforced concrete and requires less
material to construct than other types of arches.
iii. Two Hinged Arch :
a.
It is indeterminate to the first degree. This structure can be made statically
determinate by replacing one of the hinges with a roller.
b.
Due to roller, capacity of the structure to resist bending along its span
has been removed and it would serve as a curved beam not as an arch.
c.
It is commonly made from metal or timber.
iv.
Three Hinged Arch : It is statically determinate and made of metal or
timber. It is not affected by settlement or temperature changes.
v.
Tied Arch :
a.
Tied arch allows the structure to behave as a rigid unit. Tied rod carries
the horizontal component of thrust at the supports.

Based on the Material of Construction :
i.
Steel arches.
ii.
Reinforced arches.
iii.
Concrete arches.
iv.
Timber arches.
v.
Brick arches.
vi.
Stone arches.
Brick and stone arches are combinedly known as masonry arches.
2
Based on Support Conditions and Structural Behaviour :
i.
Three hinged arches - Hinged at crown and abutments.
ii.
Two hinged arches - Hinged at abutment only.
iii.
Hingeless or fixed arches - No hinges at all.
3.

Answer
A. Linear Arch (Theoretical Arch or the Line of Thrust) :
1.
Consider an arch (two hinged or three hinged) subjected to a load system
as point loads W1, W2 and W3- 3°
2.
Let VA and VB be the vertical reactions at the supports A and B. Let H be
the horizontal thrust.
3.
Let pq, qr and rs represent the loads W1, W2, W3- Let m be a point such
that mp represents the vertical reaction VA at A and sm represents the
vertical reaction VB at B. Let mo represent the horizontal thrust. Join
op, oq, or and os.
4. Taking o as the pole we draw a funicular polygon ACDEB. In this
diagram AC is parallel to op, CD is parallel to oq, DE is parallel to or and
EB is parallel to os.
5.
Now consider a structure ACDEB consisting of members AC, CD, DE
and EB which are all pin jointed and subjected to the loads W1. W2 and W3
at C, D and E.

This structure ACDEB is called the linear arch or the theoretical are
Definition of Linear Arch : Linear arch or theoretical arch or line
thrust is a funicular polygon structure of a two hinged or three hinged
arch. It is assumed to be pin jointed at the point of action of the load. The
different members of the linear arch are subjected to axial compressive
forces and the joints of this linear arch are in equilibrium.
B. Eddy's Theorem :
Statements : The bending moment at any section of an arch is
proportional to the vertical intercept between the linear arch and the
centre line of the actual arch.
Proof:
1.
It can be easily realized that the shape of the linear arch follows the
shape of the free bending moment diagram for a beam of the same span
and subjected to the same loading.
2.
Free BM at any section X = Polar distance om x y' = Hy'
Moment due to horizontal thrust = Hy
where y and y' are the ordinates of the given and linear arches
respectively
Net BM at the section X = Hy - Hy' = H(y-:
Net BM at section X is proportional to (y-y'). -
3.
Hence the BM at any section of an arch is proportional to the ordinate or
the intercept between the given arch and the linear arch. This principle
is called Eddy's theorem.
4.
Fig. 5.2.2 shows both the given arch and the linear arch corresponding
to the given load system.

The actual BM at the section X is proportional to the ordinate x,x.

3.
Resultant thrust T can be resolved normal and tangential to the section
PQ.
4.
Let N be the normal component and F be the tangential component.
5.
The tangential component Fwill cause shear force at the section PQ and
normal component N acts eccentrically, the eccentricity being equal to
CD.
6.
Thus the action of N acting at D is two fold.

Que 5.4.
Define pressure line and explain its significance in the
analysis of arches. State and prove Eddy's theorem.
Answer
Pressure Line :
1
Fig. 5.4.1(a) indicates the funicular polygon (or force polygon)
corresponding to the polar diagram of Fig. 5.4.1(b).
2
This funicular polygon indicates a system of hinged bars supported at
1 and 2.
3.
The profile so formed is in equilibrium under the action of the applied
loads (P1. P2 and P3).
4.
In cases the structure has the profile of the force polygon, the bending
moment at any section will be zero.
5.
The structure in such a case will be subjected only to axial compression.
6.
Such a profile along the length of a beam or frame is known as pressure
line or line of thrust.
7.
The pressure line thus represents the profile for a given system of
forces, which would induce only compressive forces.
8.
The profile of a pressure line resembles an arch with linear segments,
the profile is sometimes known as a linear arch.
9.
It is not possible to maintain such a profile for all combinations of loads
on a structure.
10. The pressure line varies from one loading case to another.
11. Thus in general a structural profile is subjected to bending moment
under the action of a given loading system, the bending moment in a

Answer
A.
Horizontal Thrust :
1.
Let the horizontal thrust at each support be H.
2.
Due to symmetry, each vertical reaction = wR.
3.
We know that for a three hinged arch of span L and rise h carries a UDL

1.
The bending moment at any section X-X, the radius vector corresponding
to which makes an angle e with the horizontal is given by,
I = - 2 -
(5.12.1)
2.
From A ODE, X = R (1 - cos 0),
y = R sin e
3.
Value of I and y put in eq. (5.12.1), we get
M, x = x - -

= wR² (1 cos 0) - 2 (1 - sin

- = (1 + cos 0)
wR²
=
= wR² sin² e wR² sin e = [sin o - sin² 0]
2
2
2
Since sin o being greater than sin² o the bending moment at any section
of the arch is a negative or a hogging moment.
4.
For M, to be a maximum,
=
- WRE [cos e - 2 sin o cos e) = o
2
cos e (1 - 2 sin 0) = o
Either,
cos e = 0 or 1 - 2 sin e = o
o = 90° or o = 30°
But at e = 90° i.e., at the crown the bending moment equals to zero.

Taking moment about support B, IMB = o
VA x 36 - 30 x 18 x 27 - 60 x 9 = o
VA = 420 kN
From eq. (5.16.1), V, B = 600 - 420 = 180 kN
3.
Taking moment about hinge point C, Mc = o
VA x 18 - 30 x 18 x 9 = 6 x H A
420 x 18 - 30 x 18 x 9 = 6 x H

Memory Based Questions
4.1. What do you understand by the term rolling load ?
Ans. Rolling Load (or Moving Load) : In actual practice, we often
encounter with the loads which are moving or with positions that
are liable to change.
Example : Axle loads of moving trucks or vehicles, wheel loads of
a
railway train or wheel loads of a gantry assembly on a gantry
girder etc.
4.2. What do you understand by influence line ?
Ans. An influence line represents the variation of either the reaction,
shear, moment, or deflection at a specific point in a member as a
concentrated load or forces that moves over the member.
4.3. What are the advantages of influence lines ?
Ans. Following are the advantages of influence lines :
i.
If a structure is subjected to a live load or moving load, however the
variation of the shear and bending moment in the member is best
described using the influence line.
ii.
The magnitude of the associated reaction, shear, moment or
deflection at the point can be calculated from the ordinates of the
influence line diagram.
iii.
Influence lines plays an important role in the design of bridges,
industrial crane rails, conveyors and other structures where loads
move across their span.
4.4. Define influence line diagram (ILD).
Ans: A curve or graph that represents the function like a reaction at
support, the shear force at a section, bending moment at a section
of a structure etc., for various positions of a unit load on the span of
the structure is called an influence line diagram for the function
represented.

Rolling Loads and Influence Line Diagrams
4.5. What is the difference between ILD and shear force or
bending moment diagrams ?
AKTU 2016-17, Marks 02
Ans
i.
The ordinate of a curve of bending moment or shear force gives the
value of the bending moment or shear force at the section where
the ordinate has been drawn.
In case of an influence line diagram, the ordinate at any point gives
the value of bending moment or shear force only at the given
section and not at the point at which ordinate has been drawn.
ii. Influence line diagram represent the effect of a moving load only at
a specified point on the member, whereas shear force or bending
moment diagram represent the effect of fixed loads at all points
along the axis of the member.
4.6. State Muller-Breslau's principle for determinnte structure.
AKTU 2015-16, Marks 02
Ans. According to this principle "the influence line for a function (reaction,
shear, or moment) is to the same scale as the deflected shape of the
beam when the beam is acted upon by the function".
4.7. What do you understand by influence line for beam ?
Ans
If influence line for a function (reaction, shear or moment) has
been constructed, it will be possible to position the live loads on
the
beam which will produce the maximum value of function.
There are two types of loadings to be considered :
i. For concentrated load, and
ii. For uniform load.
4.8. What do you understand by influence line for truss ?
Ans.
Since, the truss members are affected only by the joint loading, we
can obtain the ordinate values of the influence line for a member
by loading each joint with a unit load, then use the method of joints
or method of selection to calculate the force in the member. The
data can be arranged in tabular form listing unit load at joint versus
force in member.
