THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE. HYDROLOGIC CYCLE IS THE PROCESS OF TRANSFER OF MOISTURE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF PRECIPITATION, CONVEYANCE OF THE PRECIPITATED WATER BY STREAMS AND RIVERS TO OCEAN AND LAKES ETC., AND EVAPORATION OF WATER BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 1.1.1. THIS CYCLE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PROCESSES : 1. EVAPORATION AND TRANSPIRATION (E) : THE WATER FROM THE SURFACES OF OCEAN, RIVERS, LAKES AND ALSO FROM THE MOIST SOIL EVAPORATES. THE  ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT. 1-3 C (CE-SEM-4) VAPOURS ARE CARRIED OVER THE LAND BY AIR IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS. TRANSPIRATION IS THE PROCESS OF WATER BEING LOST FROM THE LEAVES OF THE PLANTS FROM THEIR PORES. THUS THE TOTAL EVAPORATION (E). INCLUSIVE OF THE TRANSPIRATION CONSISTS OF: I. SURFACE EVAPORATION. WATER SURFACE EVAPERATION. A FROM RIVER SURFACE. B. FROM OCEANS. III. EVAPORATION FROM PLANTS AND LEAVES (TRANSPIRATION). IV. ATMOSPHERIC EVAPORATION. 2 PRECIPITATION (P): PRECIPITATION MAY BE DEFINED AS THE FALL OF MOISTURE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE EARTH SURFACE IN ANY FORM. PRECIPITATION MAY BE OF TWO FORMS : I LIQUID PRECIPITATION : I.E. RAINFALL. II FROZEN PRECIPITATION : THIS CONSISTS OF : A SNOW. B. HAIL. C. SLEET. D FREEZING RAIN. 3. RUNOFF (R) : RUNOFF IS THAT PORTION OF PRECIPITATION THAT IS NOT EVAPORATED WHEN MOISTURE FALLS TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE AS PRECIPITATION, A PART OF IT IS EVAPORATED FROM THE WATER SURFACE, SOIL AND VEGETATION AND THROUGH TRANSPIRATION BY PLANTS. AND THE REMAINDER PRECIPITATION IS AVAILABLE AS RUNOFF WHICH ULTIMATELY RUNS TO THE OCEAN THROUGH SURFACE OR SUB-SURFACE STREAMS. THUS RUNOFF MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS : I. SURFACE RUNOFF : WATER FLOWS OVER THE LAND AND IS FIRST TO REACH THE STREAMS AND RIVERS, WHICH ULTIMATELY DISCHARGE THE WATER TO THE SEA. II. INTER-FLOW OR SUB-SURFACE RUNOFF : A PORTION OF PRECIPITATION INFILTRATES INTO SURFACE SOIL AND DEPENDING UPON THE GEOLOGY OF THE BASINS, RUNS AS SUB-SURFACE RUNOFF AND REACHES THE STREAMS AND RIVERS. III. GROUNDWATER FLOW OR BASE FLOW : IT IS THAT PORTION OF PRECIPITATION, WHICH AFTER INFILTRATION, PERCOLATES DOWN AND JOINS THE GROUNDWATER RESERVOIR WHICH IS ULTIMATELY CONNECTED TO THE OCEAN. THUS, THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE MAY BE EXPRESSED BY THE FOLLOWING SIMPLIFIED EQUATION : PRECIPITATION (P) = EVAPORATION (E) + RUNOFF (R)

5|WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY PRECIPITATION ? EXPLAIN VARIOUS TYPES OF PRECIPITATION.  ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT. 1-7C (CE-SEM-4)||PRECIPITATION : TO THE HYDROLOGIST, PRECIPITATION IS THE GENERAL TERM FOR ALL FORMS OF MOISTURE EMANATING FROM THE CLOUDS AND FALLING TO THE GROUND. TYPES OF PRECIPITATION : 1. CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION : CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION RESULTS FROM LIFTING OF AIR MASSES CONVERGING INTO LOW PRESSURE AREA OF CYCLONE. THE CYCLONIC PRECIPITATION MAY BE DIVIDED INTO (A) FRONTAL PRECIPITATION, AND (B) NON-FRONTAL PRECIPITATION. 2 CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION : I. CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION IS CAUSED BY NATURAL RISING OF WARMER LIGHTER AIR IN COLDER, DENSER SURROUNDINGS. IL THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE MAY RESULT FROM UNEQUAL HEATING AT THE SURFACE, UNEQUAL COOLING AT THE TOP OF THE AIR LAYER, OR MECHANICAL LIFTING WHEN AIR IS FORCED TO PASS OVER DENSER COLDER AIR MASSES. ILL. CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION IS SPOTTY AND ITS INTENSITY MAY VARY FROM LIGHT SHOWERS TO CLOUD BURSTS. 3. OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION : I. OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION IS DUE TO THE LIFTING OF WARM MOISTURE LADEN AIR MASSES DUE TO TOPOGRAPHIC BARRIERS (SUCH AS MOUNTAINS). II. AS IT REACHES HIGHER ELEVATION, IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH COLD AIR AND PRECIPITATION OCCURS. III. THE ZONE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN WILL BE THE ZONE OF RAIN SHADOW AREA WHERE THE RAINFALL MAY NOT OCCUR, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE. 1.6.1. IV. ALL THE PRECIPITATION WE HAVE IN HIMALAYAN REGION IS BECAUSE OF THE OROGRAPHIC ASCENT OF AIR MASSES, RICH IN MOISTURE CONTENT BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG TRAVEL OVER OCEANS. CLOUDS CLOUDS CLOUDS RAIN SHADOW P WIND HILL EVAPORATION FIGURE. 1.6.1. OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION  1-8 C (CE-SEM-8)  4. PRECIPITATION DUE TO TURBULENT ASCENT : I. AIR MASS IS FORCED TO RISE UP DUE TO GREATER FRICTION OF EARTH SURFACE AFTER ITS TRAVEL OVER OCEAN. II. THE AIR MASS RISES UP BECAUSE OF INCREASED TURBULENCE AND FRICTION, WHEN IT ULTIMATELY CONDENSES AND PRECIPITATION OCCURS.

32|DEFINE RUNOFF AND DISCUSS THE TYPES OF RUNOFF.||RUNOFF: 1. RUNOFF MEANS THE DRAINING OR FLOWING OFF OF PRECIPITATION FROM A CATCHMENT AREA THROUGH A SURFACE CHANNEL. 2. IT REPRESENTS THE OUTPUT FROM THE CATCHMENT IN A GIVEN UNIT OF TIME. TYPES OF RUNOFF : BASED ON THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN THE PRECIPITATION AND THE RUNOFF, THE RUNOFF IS CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES AS : 1. DIRECT RUNOFF: I. IT IS THAT PART OF THE RUNOFF WHICH ENTERS INTO THE STREAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE RAINFALL. II. IT INCLUDES SURFACE RUNOFF, PROMPT INTERFLOW AND RAINFALL ON THE SURFACE OF THE STREAM. III. IN THE CASE OF SNOW-MELT, THE RESULTING FLOW ENTERING INTO THE STREAM IS ALSO A DIRECT RUNOFF. IV. SOMETIMES TERMS SUCH AS DIRECT STORM RUNOFF AND STORM RUNOFF ARE USED TO DESIGNATE DIRECT RUNOFF. 2 BASE FLOW : I. THE DELAYED FLOW THAT REACHES TO A STREAM ESSENTIALLY AS GROUNDWATER FLOW IS CALLED BASE FLOW. II. MANY TIMES DELAYED INTERFLOW IS ALSO INCLUDED UNDER THIS CATEGORY. III. IN THE ANNUAL HYDROGRAPH OF A PERENNIAL STREAM, THE BASE FLOW IS EASILY RECOGNIZED AS THE SLOWLY DECREASING FLOW OF THE STREAM IN RAINLESS PERIODS.

FACTORS : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RUNOFF FROM A CATCHMENT AREA : 1. PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS : I. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR ON WHICH RUNOFF DEPENDS. IMPORTANT PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE : A. INTENSITY. B. DURATION. C. AERIAL DISTRIBUTION. D. DIRECTION OF STORM MOVEMENT. E. FORM OF PRECIPITATION. F. EVAPO-TRANSPIRATION.  2-6 C (CE-SEM-8) RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS II. MORE THE RAINFALL MORE WILL BE THE RUNOFF. RUNOFF DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF THE STORM CAUSING PRECIPITATION, AND ALSO UPON ITS DURATION. III. RUNOFF ALSO INCREASES WIT THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL. RUNOFF ALSO INCREASES WITH THE EXTENT OF THE ST RM OVER THE CATCHMENT. IV. IF THE RAINFALL INTENSITY IS VERY LESS, AND IT RAINS AS LIGHT SHOWERS, MUCH OF THE WATER WILL BE LOST IN INFILTRATION AND EVAPORATION ETC., AND THE RUNOFF WILL BE LESS. GREATER EVAPO-TRANSPIRATION WILL RESULT IN LESSER RUNOFF. V. SIMILARLY, IF THE PRECIPITATION IS IN THE FORM OF SNOW, OR IF WATER FREEZES AS IT FALLS, IT WILL BE RETAINED IN THE CATCHMENT TILL TEMPERATURE INCREASES. THUS RUNOFF WILL BE LESS. 2 SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE CATCHMENT : I. THE RUNOFF FROM A CATCHMENT ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE, SHAPE AND LOCATION OF THE CATCHMENT. II. MORE INTENSE RAINFALLS ARE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED OVER A RELATIVELY SMALLER AREA A STREAM COLLECTING WATER FROM A SMALL CATCHMENT AREA IS LIKELY TO GIVE GREATER RUNOFF INTENSITY PER UNIT AREA. III. IN THE CASE OF A VERY BIG CATCHMENT, UNIFORM RAIN SELDOM FALLS OVER THE ENTIRE AREA, WITH THE RESULT THAT ONLY VERY FEW TRIBUTARIES OF THE STREAM FEED WATER TO MAIN STREAM DURING A PARTICULAR STORM. IV. THUS RUNOFF INTENSITY OF LARGER STREAM, PER UNIT CATCHMENT AREA IS LESSER. V. IN THE CASE OF A FAN OR SECTOR SHAPED CATCHMENT FIGURE. 2.4.1(A) ALL THE TRIBUTARIES ARE APPROXIMATELY OF THE SAME SIZE. VI. SUCH CATCHMENT GIVES GREATER RUNOFF SINCE THE PEAK FLOOD FROM THE TRIBUTARIES IS LIKELY TO REACH THE MAIN STREAM APPROXIMATELY AT THE SAME TIME. VII. IN THE CASE OF A FERN LEAF CATCHMENT FIGURE. 2.4.1(B), THE TRIBUTARIES ARE GENERALLY OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS, AND MEET THE MAIN STREAM AT THE REGULAR INTERVALS. WATERSHED WATERSHED MAIN STREAM WATERSHED MAIN STREAM (A) FAN SHAPED CATCHMENT (B) FERN LEFT CATCHMENT FIGURE. 2.4.1. EFFECT OF SHAPE OF THE CATCHMENT. 3. TOPOGRAPHY OF CATCHMENT : I. THE RUNOFF DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE SURFACE OF THE CATCHMENT IS SMOOTH OR RUGGED. II. IF THE SURFACE SLOPE IS STEEP, WATER WILL FLOW QUICKLY, AND ABSORPTION AND EVAPORATION LOSSES WILL BE LESS, RESULTING IN GREATER RUNOFF.  ENGG HYDROLOGY & GROUND WATER MGMT. 2-7C (CE-SEM-8) III. IF THE CATCHMENT IS MOUNTAINOUS, AND IS ON THE WINDWARD SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS, THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL WILL BE MORE, AND HENCE RUNOFF WILL ALSO BE MORE. 4. ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED : I. THE ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED AFFECTS THE EVAPORATION AND TRANSPIRATION LOSS BY INFLUENCING THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RECEIVED FROM THE SUN. II. THE NORTH AND SOUTH ORIENTATION OF WATERSHED AFFECTS THE MELTING TIME OF COLLECTED SNOW AND HENCE THE RUNOFF. III. SIMILARLY, IN MOUNTAINOUS WATERSHED, THE WINDWARD SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN RECEIVES COMPARATIVELY HIGHER INTENSE RAINFALL THAN THE LEEWARD SIDE. METHODS : THIS IS OUT OF SYLLABUS FROM SESSION 2019-20.

36|AFFECTING THE FLOOD HYDROGRAPH ?||A DESIGN FLOOD : IT IS THE VALUE OF THE INSTANTANEORUS PEAK DISCHARGE ADOPTED FOR THE DESIGN OF A PARTICULAR PROJECT OR ANY OF ITS STRUCTURE. THE TERM DERIGN FLOOD IS USED TO DENOTE THE MAXIMUM FLOOD FLOW THAT COULD BE PASSED WITHOUT DAMAGE OR SERIOUS THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF ENGINEERING STRUCTURE. B. FACTORS : FOLLOWING ARE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE FLOOD HYDROGRAPH : 1. PHYSIOGRAPHIC FACTORS : I BASIN CHARACTERISTICS: A SHAPE. B. SIZE. C. SLOPE. D NATURE OF THE VALLEY. E. ELEVATION. F. DRAINAGE DENSITY. II. INFILTRATION CHARACTERISTICS: : A LAND UNE AND COVER. B. SOIL TYPE AND GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. C. LAKES, SWAMPS AND OTHER STORAGE. III.

INITIAL LONA. III. EVAPOTRANMPIRATION. A. SHAPE OF THE BASIN : I. THE SHAPE OF THE BASIN INFLUENCES THE TIME TAKEN FOR WATER FROM THE REMOTE PARTS OF THE CATCHMENT TO ARRIVE AT THE OUTLET. THUS, THE OCCURRENCE OF THE PEAK AND HENCE THE SHAPE OF THE HYDROGRAPH ARE AFFECTED BY THE BASIN SHAPE. II. FAN-SHAPED, I.E., NEARLY SEMI CIRCULAR SHAPED CATCHMENTS GIVE HIGH PEAK AND NARROW HYDROGRAPHS WHILE ELONGATED CATCHMENTS GIVE BROAD AND LOW-PEAKED HYDROGRAPHA. 4. SIZE I. SMALL BASINS BEHAVE DIFFERENT FROM THE LARGE ONES IN TERMS OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS PHASEN OF THE RUNOFF PHENOMENON.  2-10 C (CE-SEM-8) RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS II. IN SMALL CATCHMENTS, THE OVERLAND FLOW PHASE IS PREDOMINANT OVER THE CHANNEL FLOW. III. HENCE THE LAND USE AND INTENSITY OF RAINFALL HAVE IMPORTANT ROLE ON THE PEAK FLOOD. ON LARGE BASINS THESE EFFECTS ARE SUPPRESSED AS THE CHANNEL FLOW PHASE IS MORE PREDOMINANT. 5. SLOPE : I. THE SLOPE OF THE MAIN STREAM CONTROLS THE VELOCITY OF FLOW IN THE CHANNEL. II. AS THE RECESSION LIMB OF THE HYDROGRAPH REPRESENTS THE DEPLETION OF STORAGE, THE STREAM CHANNEL SLOPE WILL HAVE A PRONOUNCED EFFECT ON THIS PART OF THE HYDROGRAPH. III. LARGE STREAM SLOPES GIVE RISE TO QUICKER DEPLETION OF STORAGE AND HENCE RESULT IN STEEPER RECESSION LIMBS OF HYDROGRAPHS. IV. THE BASIN SLOPE IS IMPORTANT IN SMALL CATCHMENTS WHERE THE OVERLAND FLOW IS RELATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT. IN SUCH CASES THE STEEPER SLOPE OF THE CATCHMENT RESULTS IN LARGER PEAK DISCHARGES. 6. DRAINAGE DENSITY : I. THE DRAINAGE DENSITY IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE TOTAL CHANNEL LENGTH TO THE TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA. II. A LARGE DRAINAGE DENSITY CREATES SITUATION CONDUCIVE FOR QUICK DISPOSAL OF RUNOFF DOWN THE CHANNELS. III. THIS FAST RESPONSE IS REFLECTED IN A PRONOUNCED PEAKED DISCHARGE. IV. IN BASINS WITH SMALLER DRAINAGE DENSITIES, THE OVERLAND FLOW IS PREDOMINANT AND THE RESULTING HYDROGRAPH IS SQUAT WITH A SLOWLY RISING LIMB. 7. CLIMATIC FACTORS : I. AMONG CLIMATIC FACTORS THE INTENSITY, DURATION, AND DIRECTION OF STORM MOVEMENT ARE THE THREE IMPORTANT ONES AFFECTING THE SHAPE OF A FLOOD HYDROGRAPH. II. FOR A GIVEN DURATION, THE PEAK AND VOLUME OF THE SURFACE RUNOFF ARE ESSENTIALLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE INTENSITY OF RAINFALL. III.

ILLUSTRATE THE METHOD WITH SUITABLE EXAMPLE IN A TABULAR FORM. 10 ANSWER A. SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH : 1. WE HAVE SEEN THAT IF THE RAINFALL AND RUNOFF RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE, UNIT HYDROGRAPHS CAN BE DERIVED. 2. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF UNGAUGED RIVERS, THESE DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IN SOME OTHER CASES, THE DATA AVAILABLE MAY BE SCANTY. 3. FOR SUCH CATCHMENTS, UNIT HYDROGRAPHS ARE DERIVED BY RELATING THE SELECTED BASIN CHARACTERISTICS TO THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH SHAPE. 4. THE RESULTING HYDROGRAPH, DERIVED FROM BASIN CHARACTERISTIES RELATIONSHIP IS KNOWN AS A SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH. B. SNYDER'S METHOD : 1. SNYDER STUDIED THE DATA OF CATCHMENTS OF APPALACHIAN HIGHLANDS OF EASTERN UNITED STATES, AND THEN DEVELOPED EMPIRICAL EQUATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC HYDROGRAPH. 2. SNYDER SELECTED THREE PARAMETERS OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH : I. BASE WIDTH, TB II. PEAK DISCHARGE, QP III. BASIN LAG, TZ. T TE = BASIN LAG T P QP 2 0.75 QP W75 W50 QP TO TIME, T FIGURE. 2.21.1. PARAMETERS OF SYNTHETIC UNIT HYDROGRAPH 3. THE EQUATIONS GIVEN BY HIM TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CATCHMENT AREA, SHAPE OF BASIN, TOPOGRAPHY, CHANNEL SLOPES, STREAM DENSITY AND CHANNEL STORAGE.  (CE-SEM-S) RUNOFF AND HYDROGRAPHS 4 HE ELIMINATED ALL THESE PARAMETERS EXCEPT THE FIRST TWO. BY INCLUDING THEM IN A SINGLE CO-EFFICIENT C. 5 HE DEALT WITH THE SUSE AND SHAPE OF THE CATCHMENT BY MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THE MAIN STREAM CHANNEL. BY PROPOSING THE FOLLOWING EQUATION FOR BASIN LAG : = CA, X LIRS - (2.21.1) WHERE, I = BASIN LAG IN HOURS, (BASIN LAG IS THE TIME BETWEEN MASS OF CENTRE OF UNIT RAINFALL OF T HOUR DURATION AND RUNOFF PEAK FLOW) C. = A CO-EFFICIENT DEPENDING UPON UNITS AND 11 DRAINAGE BASIN CHARACTERISTICS (1.35 - 1.65). L = DISTANCE FROM STATION TO CATCHMENT BOUNDARY 1' MEASURED ALONG THE MAIN STREAM, IN KM. LEE = DISTANCE ALONG THE MAIN STREAM FROM GAUGING STATION TO A POINT OPPOSITE THE CENTROID OF THE WATERSHED. IN KM. 6. THE PEAK DISCHARGE OF Q, UNIT HYDROGRAPH OF STANDARD DURATION T IS GIVEN BY, R,=2.77CC,A = (2.21.2) WHERE, QP = PEAK DISCHARGE (M³/SEC). A = CATCHMENT AREA (KM²).

THE DURATION OF SURFACE RUNOFF OR THE BASE LENGTH TB OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH IS GIVEN BY, TC=3+3(24)(DAYS) = + WHEN TB IS EXPRESSED IN HOURS, TB ==72+341 = (2.21.4) (WHERE BOTH T AND 11. ARE IN HOURS) 9. IT IS FOUND THAT EQUATION (2.21.4) GIVES UNREASONABLY LONG BASE PERIODS FOR SMALL CATCHMENTS. SOME INVESTIGATORS RECOMMEND THAT A BASE PERIOD EQUAL TO FIVE TIMES THE TIME TO PEAK SHOULD BE TAKEN : TB = T|"T, = 5.455 11 (2.21.5) ALTERNATIVELY, ASSUMING A TRIANGULAR SHAPE OF UNIT HYDROGRAPH, T, = 5.556/4P 10.

ALSO DISCUSS THE RUNOFF O-EFFICIENT C OF THE RATIONAL FORMULA. 10||RATIONAL METHODS : AMONGST VARIOUS TYPES OF EMPIRICAL RELATIONS, RATIONAL FORMULA IS THE MOST RATIONAL METHOD OF CALCULATING PEAK DISCHARGE FOR SMALL CATCHMENTS. IN THIS METHOD, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MAXIMUM FLOOD FLOW IS PRODUCED BY A CERTAIN RAINFALL INTENSITY WHICH LASTS FOR A TIME EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF CONCENTRATION TIME (TD) THE MAXIMUM RATE OF RUNOFF FROM THE WATERSHED APPEARS WHEN THE ENTIRE AREA CONTRIBUTES AT THE BASIN OUTLET. THE RUNOFF GRADUALLY INCREASES FROM ZERO TO PEAK WHEN THE RAINFALL DURATION REACHES THE TIME OF CONCENTRATION (T). IF THE RAINFALL CONTINUES BEYOND TOR THE RUNOFF WILL BE CONSTANT AND AT THE PEAK VALUE. THE PEAK VALUE OF RUNOFF IS GIVEN BY, QP = FU CIA WHERE, C = RUNOFF CO-EFFICIENT REPRESENTING A RATIO OF RUNOFF TO RAINFALL. A = CATCHMENT AREA IN KM². I = RAINFALL INTENSITY IN CM/HOUR.

NAUSAY II FLOODS IN THESE RIVERN OCCUR DURING MONACON MONTHS AND USUALLY IN THE MONTHS OF AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER. THE DAMAGEA CAUMED BY FLONDA ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. III. DURING 1953-2004, THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HUMAN LIVEN AND CATTLE LOST DUE TO FLOODS IN THE COUNTRY WERE 1597 AND 94,000 RESPECTIVELY IV. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ANNUALLY, ON AN AVERAGE ABOUT 40 MHA OF LAND IN LIABLE TO FLOODING AND OF THIS ABOUT 14 MHA HAVE SOME KIND OF FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES. V. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT MILLENNIUM, IN THE COUNTRY, AS PER FINOD CONTROL MEASURES, THERE WERE ABOUT 15800 KM OF LEVEES AND ABOUT 32000 KM OF DRAINAGE CHANNEL AFFORDING PROTECTION FROM FLOODS. VI. ON AN AVERAGE, ABOUT. 7.5 MHA LAND IS AFFECTED BY FLOOD ANNUALLY. OUT OF THIS, ABOUT 3.56 MHA ARE LANDA UNDER CROPS. VII.

A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT WAS LAUNCHED IN 1954 AND AN AMOUNT OF 3165 CRORES WAS SPENT TILL 1992. THE TENTH PLAN (2002-2007) HAD AN EXPENDITURE OF 4468 CRORES FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT.
64|ANSWER||A. FLOOD FORECASTING AND WARNING : 1. FORECASTING OF FLOODS SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE ENABLES A WARNING TO BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AND FURTHER ENABLES CIVIL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. 2. IT THUS FORMS A VERY IMPORTANT AND RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE NON-STRUCTURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT MEASURE. 3. HOWEVER, IT MUST BE REALIZED THAT A FLOOD WARNING IS MEANINGFUL ONLY IF IT IS GIVEN SUFFICIONTLY IN ADVANCE. 4. FURTHER, ERRONEOUS WARNINGS WILL CAUSE THE POPULACE TO LOSE CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. THUS THE DUAL REQUIREMENTS OF RELIABILITY AND ADVANCE NOTICE ARE THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF A FLOOD FORECASTING SYSTEM.

82|WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY CAVITY FORMATION IN OPEN WELL ?||CAVITY FORMATION IN OPEN WELL : 1. CONSIDER A WELL FROM WHICH NO WATER IS BEING WITHDRAWN. 2. THE WATER LEVEL IN SUCH A WELL WILL OBVIOUSLY BE THE SAME AS IS THE STATIE WATERTABLE OUTSIDE THE WELL. 3. NOW, IF A DISCHARGE IS WITHDRAWN FROM THIS WELL AT A CONSTANT RATE, THE LEVEL IN THE WELL WILL GO DOWN AND STABILIZE AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE OUTSIDE WATERTABLE. 4. THE HEAD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO LEVELS IS CALLED THE DEPRESSION HEAD. 5. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HEAD DIFFERENCE, WATER ENTERS THE WELL, FROM OUTSIDE, SO AS TO FILL THE GAP CREATED BY THE WITHDRAWAL WATER. 6. AS THE WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL TRAVELS TOWARDS THE WELL. THERE IS A GRADUAL LOSS OF HEAD, AND WATER SURFACE DROPS TOWARDS THE WELL. 7. SINCE THE SAME DISCHARGE IS PASSING THROUGH THE REDUCING SOIL AREAS AS IT APPROACHES THE WELL, THERE IS A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE FLOW VELOCITY CAN GRADUALLY INCREASE ONLY FTHE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT GETS GRADUALLY INCREASED. 8. HENCE, THE WATER SURFACE WILL FALL GENTLY IN THE BEGINNING AND WILL FALL MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY AS IT APPROACHES THE WELL. 9. THE SURFACE OF WATER TABLE SURROUNDING THE WELL. THEREFORE, TAKES UP A CURVED SHAPE AND IS CALLED THE CONE OF DEPRESSION. 10. AT. A CORTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE WELL IS CALLED THE RADIUS OF INFLUENCE OF THE WELL.  4-32 C (CE-SEM-8) GROUNT DER 11. THE VELOCITY OF PERCOLATING WATER INTO THE WELL DEPENDS UPON THE DEPRESSION HEAD. 12. IF MORE AMOUNT OF WATER IS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WELL, THEREBY INCREASING THE DEPRESSION HEAD, HIGHER FLOW VELOCITIES WILL PREVAIL IN THE VICINITY OF WELL. 13. THUS, AT A CERTAIN RATE OF WITHDRAWAL, IT IS VERY MUCH POSSIBLE THAT THE FLOW VELOCITY MAY EXCEED THE CRITICAL VELOCITY FOR THE SOIL, THEREBY CAUSING THE SOIL PARTICLES TO LIFT UP. 14. AS MORE AND MORE SAND PARTICLES ARE LIFTED, A HOLLOW IS CREATED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL. RESULTING IN THE INCREASED EFFECTIVE AREA, SO THAT ULTIMATELY. THE VELOCITY FALLS BELOW THE CRITICAL VALUE AND THEN NO FURTHER SAND GOES OUT OF THE WELL. DEPRESSION HEAD HOLLOW SAND FORMATION FIGURE. 4.26.1. CAVITY FORMATION.

A PLUNGER WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE PUMP HANDLE ROD MOVES UP AND DOWN IN THE CYLINDER. IT CAN BE HAND OPERATED OR DRIVEN BY A 1 OR 2 HP (V-BELT DRIVEN) MOTOR. III. PUMP HANDLES OFTEN GET BROKEN IN CONSTANT VILLAGE USE; HANDLES SHOULD BE KEPT IN SPARE AS ALSO EXTRA BOLTS, NUT AND BUSHINGS NEEDED AT THE MOVING JOINT OF THE HANDLE. IV. VILLAGERS SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO HANDLE THE PUMPS GENTLY. THE PUMP SHOULD BE SET SO THAT THE CYLINDER IS WITHIN 6.7-7.6 M OF THE LOWEST WATER TABLE. AND CAN PUMP OF A TOTAL HEAD OF 45-60 M. 2. JET PUMPS : I. JET PUMPS ARE OFTEN PRACTICABLE FOR PUMPING RATHER SMALL FLOWS (40-90 LPM) UNDER LOW HEADS (15-45 M) WHEN THE WATER LEVEL IS BEYOND 7.6 M FROM THE GROUND SURFACE. THEIR CAPACITY REDUCES AS THE LIFT INCREASES. II. AJET PUMP CONSISTS OF A PUMP AND A JET. III. WATER IS RECIRCULATED FROM THE DELIVERY SIDE OF THE PUMP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SUCTION PIPE AND IS INJECTED THROUGH A NOZZLE TO IMPART ADDITIONAL KINETIC ENERGY. IV. THIS GIVES ADDITIONAL SUCTION LIFT BY CREATING A PARTIAL VACUUM AT THIS POINT. V. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE JET PUMP OVER MOST OTHER TYPES OF DEEP-WELL PUMPS IS THAT THE PUMP AND MOTOR MAY BE SET AWAY FROM THE WELL. VI. JET PUMPS ARE USUALLY USED FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND HOTELS. VII. THESE ARE OF TWO TYPES : TWIN TYPE FOR BORE WELLS 15 EM AND ABOVE, AND PACKER TYPE (DUPLEX) FOR BORE WELLS LESS THAN 15 EM. 3. DEEP WELL VERTICAL TURBINE PUMPS : I. DEEP-WELL VERTICAL TURBINE PUMPS ARE MOST WIDELY USED FOR LARGE TUBE WELLS. II. THE BOWL-ASSEMBLY (IMPELLERS) IS KEPT BELOW THE LOWEST PUMPING WATER LEVEL, BUT THE DRIVING UNIT-ELECTRIC MOTOR OR PETROL OR DIESEL ENGINE-IS ON THE GROUND SURFACE AND IS CONNECTED BY A LONG SHAFT.

WHILE THE EXPECTED SERVICE LIFE OF A WELL DEPENDS UPON THE DESIGN. CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE WELL. PROPER MAINTENANCE HELPS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND INCREASE THE LIFE OF THE WELL. 2. PROPER RECORDS OF POWER CONSUMPTION. WELL DISCHARGE, DRAWDOWN, OPERATING HOURS, PERIODICAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER AND. OTHER FACH OBSERVATIONS WILL HELP IN DEVISING PROPER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. 3. THE SUDDEN PRESSURE DROP AND INCREASE IN THE ENTRANCE VELOCITY NEAR THE SCREEN DUE TO HIGH PUMPING RATES RELEASES CARBON DIOXIDE AND CAUSES PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM CARBONATE AND IRON DEPOSITS NEAR THE SCREEN. 4. THE CHANGE IN ENTRANCE VELOCITIES RESULTS IN PRECIPITATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE HYDROXIDES. 5. THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN IN THE WELL CAN CHANGE SOLUBLE FERROUS IRON TO INSOLUBLE FERRIC HYDROXIDE. THE PERFORATIONS CAN BE CLEANED BY ADDING HYDROCHLORIC (MURIATIC) ACID OR CALGON FOLLOWED BY AGITATION AND SURGING WHICH REMOVES THE INCRUSTING DEPOSITS. 6. NORMALLY, THE VOLUME OF ACID REQUIRED FOR A SINGLE TREATMENT WILL BE ABOUT 1.5 TO 2 TIMES THE VOLUME OF WATER IN THE SCREEN. 7. SULFURIC ACID CAN ALSO BE USED INSTEAD OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID BUT ITS ACTION IS A LITTLE SLOWER AND REQUIRES A LONGER CONTACT TIME IN THE WELL. S. THE YIELD OF THE WELL MAY DECREASE DUE TO THE DEPOSITION OF INCRUSTATION OF FINE PARTICLES OF SILT AND CLAY NEAR THE SCREEN. THIS CAN BE REMOVED BY THE USE OF A DISPERSING AGENT SUCH AS POLYPHOSPHATES. FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, 15 TO 30 KG OF POLYPHOSPHATE IS ADDED TO EVERY 1000 LITRES OF WATER IN THE WELL. 9. 1 KG OF CALCIUM HYPOCHLORITE SHOULD BE ADDED FOR EVERY 1000 LITRES OF WATER IN THE WELL TO FACILITATE THE REMOVAL OF IRON BACTERIA AND THEIR SLIMES, AND ALSO FOR DISINFECTION PURPOSES. 10. THE SOLUTION OF POLYPHOSPHATE AND HYPOCHLORITE IS POURED INTO THE WELL
