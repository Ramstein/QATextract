Explain manufacturing processes of the cement with
neat diagram. Give comparison between wet and dry process of
manufacturing.
Answer
Manufacturing Processes : Following are the steps of
manufacturing of cement :
A.
Make Clinkers : In this step, the raw material is converted into fine
powder and it is done by following two processes :
1
Dry Process :
i
In this process calcareous material such as limestone (calcium
carbonate) and argillaceous material such as clay are ground separately
to fine powder in the absence of water and then are mixed together in
the desired proportions.
il
Water is then added to it for getting thick paste and then its cakes are
formed, dried and burnt in kilns.
in
This process is usually used when raw materials are very strong and
hard.
iv.
In this process, the raw materials are changed to powdered form in the
absence of water.
2
Wet Process :
i.
In this process, the raw materials are changed to powdered form in the
presence of water.
ii
In this process, raw materials are pulverized by using a ball mill, which
is a rotary steel cylinder with hardened steel balls.
iii.
When the mill rotates, steel balls pulverize the raw materials which
form slurry (liquid mixture).
iv.
The slurry is then passed into storage tanks, where correct
proportioning is done.
v.
Proper composition of raw materials can be ensured by using wet
process than dry process.
vi. This process is generally used when raw materials are soft because
complete mixing is not possible unless water is added.
vii. Corrected slurry is then fed into rotary kiln for burning.
The actual purpose of both processes is to change the raw materials to
fine powder.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-6 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
B. Burning :
i.
Corrected slurry is feed to rotary kiln. which is a 150-500 feet long,
8-16 feet in diameter and temperature arrangement is up to
1500-1650°C.
ii.
At this temperature slurry losses moisture and forms into small lumps,
after that changes to clinkers.
iii.
Clinkers are cooled in another inclined tube similar to kiln but of lesser
length.
C. Grinding :
i.
Now the final process is applied which is grinding of clinker, it is first
cooled down to atmospheric temperature.
ii.
Grinding of clinker is done in large tube mills. After proper grinding
gypsum (Calcium sulphate CaSO, in the ratio of 01-04 % is added for
controlling the setting time of cement.
iii.
Finally, fine ground cement is stored in storage tanks from where it is
drawn for packing.

What is hydration of cement ? Explain the process of
hydration of cement.
Answer
A.
Hydration of Cement :
1.
The reaction of cement when mixed with water is called hydration.
Both C,S and C,S make up nearly 75 % of cement.
2.
The hydration of these compounds is responsible for the setting and
hardening of cement.
3.
The hydration surface reaction starts immediately once cement comes
in contact with water. It is an exothermic reaction.
4.
The hydration continues as long as heat and moisture are available.

5. All four Begue's compounds along with gypsum are involved in the
bydration and enly a very small amount of water is needed for
E
E. Following stages occurred in the process of hydration :
1.
Stage 1 : A beat generation of rapid order takes place for close to
15 minutes The calcrum and hydrogen ions are released from the
and when certain levels of critical concentrations are reached,
the of calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydroxide beings.
The instimal reactions are dependent on the temperature.
2
Stage 2 The stage tends to be the dormant period and the cement is
forced to become plastic for a period of 2 to 4 hours. This process of
reaction tends to slew down
I
Stage 3: This 15 the acceleration period as the silicate hydrates rapidly
along with critical concentration of ions. The entire hardening takes
place and the final set IN released and the time period is generally for 4
to . hours
4.
Stage 4 : Thus is known as the deceleration stage. The overall rate of
reaction tends to slow down resulting in an independent diffusion
reatuon
s
Stage 5: This is referred to as the steady stage and the temperature
has effect on the hydration stage. The reaction process is constant
and 15 for a period of 12 to 24 hours.
The individual reaction of minerals tends to be less effective than the
combuned reaction of the hydration of cement. The hydration of cement
can be splat anto several small components it is observed that the
aluminate and the ferrite stage tend to react first and then the reactions
tend to carry over to the silicate phase.
Que 1.7.
Describe the hydration reaction of important Bogue's
compounds indicating the products of hydration.
Answer
Hydration Reaction of Bogue's Compound :
1.
Hydration of C,S :
1.
The chemical reaction of C,S with water can be expressed as
C,S
+
water
C-S-H
C-H
+
heat
where. C-S-H 15 calcium silicate hydrate and C-H is calcium hydrate
il
C-S-H. Calcium silicate hydrate constitutes 50-60% of the solids in the
paste It forma a continuous binding matrix It is amorphous and fibrous
and bence has u large surface area. It is an important factor for the
strength development of cement paste.
III. C-H, Calcium by drate makes up about 20% of the solids in the paste.
It existe in the form of thick, crystalline hexagonal plates and is
embedded in the C-S-H matrix. Ita growth fills the pore spaces It does

not significantly contribute to strength. Its leaching causes white
patches and efflorescence.
2.
Hydration of C, S :
i.
The hydration of C,S is similar to the hydration of C,S. The same
products are generated However. C,S reacts slowly and hence
generates less hent.
ii.
It contributes to strength development at later stages.
3
Hydration of C,A:
i.
This hydration reaction produces a substance called ettringite as follows
C,A
gypsum
water
ettringite
heat
C.A
ettringite water monosulphoaluminate
ii.
If the amount of gypsum is too little, C,A will react fast and can cause
a 'flash set'.
iii. On the other hand, too much gypsum will delay setting and cause
undue expansion. It constitutes about 10-20 % of the solid content.
iv. It is a long. slender, and prismatic crystal and is stable only in the
presence of gypsum.
v.
It plays a minor role in strength development but contributes
considerably to durability.
vi.
Monosulphoaluminate is a stable hydration product. It is fairly
crystalline.
4.
Hydrution of CAF:
i.
The hydration of C,AF is similar to that of C,A: the same products are
formed.
ii.
However, C.AF reacts slowly and hence generates less heat and
combines well with gypsum.

hydroxido us much INS that of OPC.
4.
It generates reduced heat of hydration and that too at in low rate.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
1-11 D (CE-Sem-5)
5.
PPC being finer than OPC and also due to pozzolanic action, it improves
the pore size distribution and also reduces the microcracks at the
transition zone.
6.
As the fly ash is finer and of lower density, the bulk volume of 50 kg
bag is slightly more than OPC. Therefore, PPC gives more volume of
mortar than OPC.
7.
The long term strength of PPC beyond a couple of months is higher
than OPC if énough moisture is available for continued pozzolanic
action.

Que 1.12.
What is meant by aggregate ? Briefly describe their
classification.
Answer
A.
Aggregate : These are inert materials which are mixed with binding
material such as cement or lime for manufacturing of mortar or
concrete. Aggregate are used as filler in mortar and concrete and also
to reduce their cost.
B.
Classifiention of Aggregate :
1.
According to Geological Origin :
i.
Natural Aggregate :
1.
These aggregates are generally obtained from natural deposits of sand
and gravels or from quarries by cutting rocks.
2.
The cheapest among them are the natural sand and gravel which have
been reduced to their present size by natural agents, such as water,
wind and snow, etc.
3.
The river deposits are the most common and are good quality.
ii.
Artificial Aggregate :
1.
The most widely used artificial aggregate are clean broken bricks and
air cooled fresh blast-furnace-slag.
2.
The broken bricks of good quality provide a satisfactory aggregate for
the mass concrete and are not suitable for reinforced concrete work if
the crushing strength of brick is less than 30 to 35 MPa.
3.
The bricks should be free from lime mortar and lime sulphate plaster
4.
The bricks aggregate is not suitable for waterproof construction
5.
It has poor resistance to wear and hence is not used in concrete for the
road work.
2
According to Size :
i.
Fine Aggregate :
1.
The aggregate which passes through 4.75 mm sieve and retained on 75
micron sieve are known as fine aggregate.
ii.
Coarse Aggregate :
1.
The aggregate retained on 4.75 mm sieve are known as coarse
aggregate.
iii. All-in-Aggregate :
1.
It is the combination of both coarse and fine aggregate.
3.
According to Shape :
i.
Rounded Shape :
a.
The aggregate with rounded particles (river or seashore gravel) has
minimum voids ranging 32 to 33 %.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-16 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
b.
The only disadvantage is that interlocking between its particles is less
and hence the development of bond is poor, making it unsuitable for
high strength concrete and pavement.
ii. Irregular Aggregate :
The aggregate having partly rounded particles (pit sand and gravel)
a.
has higher of voids ranging from 35 to 38%.
b.
It required more cement paste for a given workability.
iii. Angular Aggregate : The aggregate with sharp, angular and rough
particles (crushed rocks) has a maximum of voids ranging from 38 to
40 %. The interlocking between the particles is good.
iv. Flaky Aggregate :
a.
An aggregate is termed flaky when its least dimension (thickness) is
less than three-fifth of its mean dimension.
b.
The presence of these particles should be restricted to 10 to 15 %.
4.
According to Unit Weight :
i.
Normal Weight Aggregate : The commonly used aggregate, i.e.
sands and gravels; crushed rocks such as granite, basalt quartz,
sandstone and limestone; and brick ballast, etc., which have specific
gravities between 2.5 and 2.7 produce concrete with unit weight ranging
23 to 26 kN/m² and crushing strength at 28 days between 15 to 40 MPa
are termed normal weight concrete.
ii.
Heavy Weight or High-Density Aggregate : Concrete having unit
weight of about 30, 31, 35, 38, 40, 47 and 57 kN/m³ can be produced by
using typical goethite, limonite, baryte, magnetite, hematite,
ferrophosphorus and scrapiron. respectively.
iii. Light Weight Aggregate : The light weight aggregate having unit
weight up to12 kN/m³ are used to manufacture the structural concrete
masonry blocks for reduction of the self weight of the structure.

3.
It should not absorb water more than 5 %.
4.
It should have rough surface.
5.
It should not react with cement after mixing.
6.
It should be durable and strong.

3.
Rough : It reduce workability but bond between cement paste and
aggregate is strong.
4. Surface texture is not a very important property from compressive
strength point of view but aggregate having rough surface texture
perform better under flexural and tensile stresses.
Que 1.17.
What is alkali aggregate reaction ? What are the factors
which affect this reaction ? How can this reaction be controlled ?
Answer
A.
Alkali Aggregate Reaction :
1.
The phenomenon is accompanied by extensive expansion and may
lead in bad cases to complete disruption and disintegration of the
concrete and is known as alkali-aggregate reaction or sometimes
concrete cancer.
2
The trouble is due to reaction between silica in aggregate and alkalis in
the cement.
3.
In some cases alkalis, mainly from the cement supplemented by alkalis
in the aggregate, react with carbonates in the aggregate to produce
similar result.
4.
The types of rocks which contain reactive constituents include traps,
andesites, rhyolites, siliceous limestone and certain types of sandstones.
5.
The reactive components may be in the form of opals, cherts,
chalcedony, volcanic glass (excepting basaltic glasses), zeolites, and
tridymite.
B.
Factors Affecting Alkali-Aggregate Reaction :
1.
Reactive Type of Aggregates : Reactive material have been found
to have serious effects if present in small quantities but not if it
constitutes the whole of the aggregate.
2
High Alkali Content Cement : If the cement contains less than
0.4 % alkalis (computed as Na,O) no expansion or disruptive effect is
likely even with a quite highly reactive aggregate, but due to difficulties
of manufacture it is not usual to specify an alkali content of less than
0.6%.
3.
Availability of Moisture : Progress of the Ikali-aggregate reaction
takes place only in the presence of water.
4.
Temperature Condition : The favourable temperature for the
reaction is 10-38 °
C. Control of Alkali-Aggregate Reaction :
1.
By Selecting Non-Reactive Aggregate : Aggregute can be identified
by petrographic examination. The mortar bar test and the chemical
test are used.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-20 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
2.
By Using Low Alkali Cement : Cements with alkali less than
0.6 per cent should be used.
3.
By Controlling Moisture : Old concrete should not be allowed to
come in contact with water. The best way is to apply mortar with water
proofing agents on concrete surface.
4.
By Pozzolanas : When fly-ash or surkhi or crushed stone dust is
added this optimum condition of silica being in particular proportion
and fineness is disturbed and the aggregates turn to be inoffensive.
5.
By Air Entraining Agents : The alkali-silica-gel imparts osmotic
pressure over the set cement gel and this is mainly responsible for
formation of cracks. When air entraining agents are added they absorb
the osmotic pressure and control the expansion.
Que 1.18.
Describe the test conducted to determine the crushing
value, impact value and abrasion value of aggregates.
Answer
A.
Determination of Crushing Value (IS 2386 Part 4-1963) :
1.
Crushing value of aggregate is n relative measure of resistance of an
aggregate to crushing under gradually applied compressive load.
2. Aggregate passing through 12.5 mm sieve and retained on 10 mm
sieve is taken. About 6.5 kg of surface dry aggregate filled in the
standard cylinder in three layers, tamping each layer 25 times by
a
standard tamping rod. It is leveled off. Its weight found out (A).
3.
The plunger is placed on the aggregate taking care that it does not jam
the cylinder by becoming tilted.
4.
The assembly is then kept under compression testing machine and
total load of 40 tonnes is applied uniformly during 10 minutes.
5.
The load is released, the aggregate is taken out and sieve on 2.36 mm
sieve. The fraction passing through weight is (B).
6.
The aggregate crushing value is given by,
Aggregate crushing value = B/A x 100 %.
7.
Aggregate crushing value should not be more than 45 % for aggregate
used for concrete other than for wearing surface and 30 % for concrete
used for wearing surface such a runway roads, etc.
B.
Determimntion of Impact Value (IS 2386 part 4-1963) :
1.
This test gives relative measure of resistance of aggregate to suddenly
applied load or impact load.
2.
The test sample consists of aggregate passing through 12.5 mm IS
sieve and retained on 10 mm IS sieve. The aggregate is oven dried at
110 °C for 4 hours.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
1-21 D (CE-Sem-5)
3.
The aggregate is filled in the cup, (weight A). By lifting the handle,
hammer is allowed to fall freely as it is released by the tripping
mechanism, on to the aggregate in the cup.
4.
15 such blows are given and then the aggregate is taken out and sieved
on 2.36 mm sieve.
5.
The fraction passing through is weighed (weight B).
6.
The fraction retained is also weighed (weight C). If(B + C) is less than
A by more than 1 gram, the result is discarded and a fresh test is made.
7.
The aggregate impact value is given by,
Aggregate impact value = BA x 100
S.
Standard value for this test is same as crushing value test.
C.
Determination of Abrasion Value (IS 2386 Part 4-1963) :
1.
This test gives the relative resistance of aggregate to wearing.
2
There are two methods prescribed in the IS code :
i.
Deval Attrition Test, and
ii
Los Angeles Abrasion Value.
3.
But since LA test gives more realistic results, it is more commonly
used.
4.
In this method. the specified weight, 5kg or 10 kg, depending on the
size of aggregate is taken and is placed in the cylinder of the LA machine
along with the abrasive charge.
5.
The abrasion charge consists of specific number of steel balls.
6.
The cylinder is rotated at 20 to 33 rpm for 500 or 1000 revolution,
depending on the grading of the aggregate.
7.
The aggregate is removed from the cylinder and sieved on 1.75 mm
sieve.
8.
The fraction passing through 1.7 mm sieve is expressed as percentage
of original weight give the aggregate abrasion value.
9.
The percentage of wear should not be more than 16 % for cement
concrete aggregate.
Que 1.19.
What tests are used to find out the shape of the
aggregate ?
Answer
There are mainly two types of test for finding the shape of aggregate,
which are as follows :
A.
Test for Determination of Flakiness Index :
1.
The flakiness index of aggregate is the percentage by weight of particles
in it whose least dimension (thickness) is less than three-fifths of their
mean dimension. The test is not applicable to sizes smaller than
6.3 mm.
2.
This test is conducted by using a metal thickness gauge.
3.
A sufficient quantity of aggregate is taken such that a minimum number
of 200 pieces of any fraction can be tested.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-22 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
4.
Each fraction is gauged in turn for thickness on the metal gauge.
5.
The total amount passing in the gauge is weighed to an accuracy of
0.1 % of the weight of the samples taken.
6.
The flakiness index is taken as the total weight of the material passing
the various thickness gauges expressed as a percentage of the total
weight of the sample taken.
B.
Test for Determinntion of Elongation Index :
1.
The elongation index on an aggregate is the percentage by weight of
particles whose greatest dimension (length) is greater than 1.8 times
their mean dimension.
2.
The elongation index is not applicable to sizes smaller than 6.3 mm.
3.
This test is conducted by using metal length gauge.
4.
A sufficient quantity of aggregate is taken to provide a minimum
number of 200 pieces of any fraction to be tested.
5.
Each fraction shall be gauged individually for length on the metal
gauge.
6.
The total amount retained by the gauge length shall be weighed to an
accuracy of at least 0.1 % of the weight of the test samples taken.
7.
The elongation index is the total weight of the material retained on the
various length gauges expressed as a percentage of the total weight of
the sample gauged.
8.
The presence of elongated particles in excess of 10-15 % is generally
considered undesirable.
Que 1.20.
Explain the procedure for determination of 'ten percent
fines value'.
Answer
Procedure for Determination of Ten Percent Fines Value :
1.
The sample of aggregate for this test is the same as that of the sample
used for aggregate crushing value test.
2.
The apparatus, with the test sample and plunger in position is placed in
the compression testing machine.
3.
The load is applied at a uniform rate so as to cause a total penetration
of the plunger in 10 minutes of about :
i.
15 mm for rounded or partially rounded aggregates (for example
uncrushed gravels)
ii.
20.0 mm for normal crushed aggregates, and
iii.
24.0 mm for honeycombed aggregates (e.g., expanded shales and
stags).
4.
After reaching the required maximum penetration, the load is released
and the whole of the material removed from the cylinder and sieved on
a 2.36 mm IS sieve.
5.
The fines passing the sieve is weighed and the weight is expressed as
a percentage of the weight of the test sample.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
1-23 D (CE-Sem-5)
6.
This percentage would fall within the range 7.5 to 12.6, but if it does
not, repeat test is made and the load is found out which gives a
percentage of fines within the range of 7.5 to 12.5.
7.
Load required for 10 % fines

where.
X = Load in tons, causing 7.5-12.5 % fines, and
Y = Mean percentage fines from two tests at x tons
load.
Que 1.21.
What is fineness modulus ? How is sieve analysis
conducted for fine aggregates and coarse aggregates ?
Answer
A.
Fineness Modulus (FM) :
1.
The FM is an index of the fineness of the aggregate. The higher the FM
the coarser the aggregate. FM of fine aggregate is useful in estimating
proportions of fine and coarse aggregate in concrete mixtures.
2
The fineness modulus (FM) for both fine and coarse aggregates is
obtained by adding the cumulative percentages by mass retained on
each of a specified series of sieves and dividing the sum by 100.

B. Sieve Analysis :
1.
This is the name given to the operation of dividing a sample of aggregate
into various fractions each consisting of particles of the same size.
2.
The sieve analysis is conducted to determine the particle size distribution
in a sample of aggregate, which we call gradation.
3.
The aggregates used for making concrete are normally of the maximum
size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm, 10 mm, 4.75 mm, 2.36 mm, 600 micron,
300 micron and 150 micron. The aggregate fraction from 80 mm to
4.75 mm is termed as coarse aggregate and the fraction from
4.75 mm to 150 micron is termed as fine aggregate.
4.
As Per IS : 2386(Part-1) : Fine aggregate : 6 standard sieves with
openings from 150 um to 4.75 mm. (150 um, 300 um, 600 um, 1.18 mm,
2.36 mm, 4.75 mm).
5.
Coarse Aggregate : 5 sieves with openings from 4.75 mm to 80 mm.
(4.75 mm, 10 mm, 12.5 mm, 20 mm, 40 mm).
6.
The size 4.75 mm is a common fraction appearing both in coarse
aggregate and fine aggregate (CA and FA).
Scanned with CamScanner
1-24 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
7.
Grading pattern of a sample of CA or FA is assessed by sieving a
sample successively through all the sieves mounted one over the other
in order of size, with larger sieve on the top.
8.
The material retained on each sieve after shaking, represents the
fraction of aggregate coarser than the sieve in question and finer than
the sieve above.
9.
Sieving can be done either manually or mechanically.
Que 1.22.
Explain different method of measurement of moisture
content of aggregates.
Answer
Following are the method of measurement of moisture cement of
aggregates
1.
Drying Method :
i.
The application of drying method is fairly simple. Drying is carried out
in an oven and the loss in weight before and after drying will give the
moisture content of the aggregate.
ii.
If the drying is done completely at a high temperature for a long time,
the loss in weight will include not only the surface water but also some
absorbed water.
iii.
A fairly quick result can be obtained by heating the aggregate quickly
in an open pan.
iv.
The process can also be speeded up by pouring inflammable liquid such
as methylated spirit or acetone over the aggregate and igniting it.
2.
Displacement Method :
i.
In the laboratory the moisture content of aggregate can be determined
by means of pycnometer or by using Siphon-Can Method.
ii.
The principle made use of is that the specific gravity of normal aggregate
is higher than that of water and that a given weight of wet aggregate
will occupy a greater volume than the same weight of the aggregate
when dry.
iii.
By knowing the specific gravity of the dry aggregate, the specific gravity
of the wet aggregate can be calculated.
iv.
From the difference between the specific gravities of the dry and wet
aggregates, the moisture content of the aggregate can be calculated.
3.
Electrical Meter Method :
i.
Recently electrical meters have been developed to measure
instantaneous or continuous reading of the moisture content of the
aggregate.
ii.
The principle that the resistance gets changed with the change in
moisture content of the aggregate has been made use of.
4.
Automatic Measurement :
1.
In modern batching plants surface moisture in aggregates is
automatically recorded by means of some kind of sensor arrangement.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology

What are the effects of impurities in the mixing water
on concrete ?
OR
Write a short note on the feasibility of use of sea water for mixing
concrete.
Answer
Effects of Mixing Water from Different Sources :
1.
Ground Water : Presence of sulphates in ground waters highly
injurious to concrete foundations.
2
Sea Water
i
The sea water generally contains 3.5 % of salts with about 75 % of
sodium chloride, about 15 % of chloride and sulphate of magnesium.
ii.
It has been found to reduce the strength of concrete by 10-20 % and
slightly accelerate the setting time.
iii.
Sea water may lead to corrosion of reinforcement.
iv.
The chlorides in sea water may cause efflorescence in concrete.
V.
The use of sea water is not recommended for prestressed concrete
because of stress corrosion and the small diameter wires.
vi.
If sea water cannot be avoided for making reinforced concrete, particular
precautions should be taken to make the concrete dense by using low
water/cement ratio coupled with vibration and to give an adequate
cover of at least 7.5 cm.
3.
Industrial Waste Water : When industrial waste water is used as
mixing water in concrete, the reduction in compressive strength is
generally less than about 10 %.
4.
Water For Washing Aggregates :
i
When aggregates are washed with water containing impurities, they
get coated with layers of silt, salts and organic matters.
ii.
These reduce the bond between the aggregates and cement and
markedly affect the strength.
5.
Water for Curing :
i
Waters containing impurities and leading to stains is objectionable.
ii.
When concrete is subjected to prolonged wetting, even a very low
concentration of iron and organic matter may cause staining.
III.
Water containing more than 0.08 ppm of iron is not recommended for
curing.

Enumerate the various impurities in water having
deleterious effects on concrete.
Scanned with CamScanner
1-26 D (CE-Sem-5)
Cement Production and Aggregates
Answer
Impurities in water can be of following types :
1.
Chlorides :
i.
Chlorides can cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement and can
accelerate setting.
ii.
The water used may be contaminated with chlorides because of it
being sea water, the presence of admixtures and de-icing salts, or
deliberate chlorination for disinfection.
2.
Sulphates : Sulphates can lead to the reformation of ettringite as well
as reduction of long-term strength levels.
3. Organic Matter : The effects of organic matter on concrete are varied.
If algae are present in water, it should not be used because it will affect
setting and strength development.
4.
Sugar: Sugar retards the setting time. Too much sugar may 'kill' the
concrete (i.e., it will not set).
5.
Wastewater: It is best not to use wastewater. Alternatively it can be
used after proper testing and treatment.

Admixtures : It is defined as a material, other than cement, water
and aggregates that is used as an ingredient of concrete and is added to
the batch immediately before or during mixing.
Types of Admixtures : According to the effects produced in concrete,
the admixtures are classified as :
i. Accelerators.
ii. Water reducing admixtures.
iii. Retarders.
iv. Air-entraining agents.
Accelerators : These are the substances which when added to
concrete, mortar or grout, increase the rate of hydration of hydraulic
cement, shorten the time of set or increase the rate of hardening or
strength development. E-g., sodium chloride.
Retarders : These are the substances which retard the setting of
cement. E.g., sugar, soluble zine salts etc.
Plasticizers : These are the substances which when added to concrete,
increase workability without increasing the water content.
Air-entraining Agents : These are the admixtures which cause air
to be incorporated in the form of minute bubbles in concrete during
mixing to increase the workability and resistance to freezing and
thawing and disruptive action of deicing salts.

Que 2.3.
Describe the accelerator effect on the concrete
properties.
Answer
Following are the accelerator effect on the concrete properties :
1.
The general action of accelerators is to cause a more rapid dissolution of
compounds of cement, particularly tricalcium silicate, in water and hence
facilitate more rapid hydration of these compounds.
2.
The use of 2 % calcium chloride by mass of cement can reduce the
setting time by one-third and raise the one to seven day compressive
strength by 3 to 8 MPa.
3.
An increase in flexural strength of 40 to 80 % of one day and up to 12 %
at 28 days in obtained.
4.
Large doses of CaCl, result in flash set of concrete and the ambient
temperature.

What is air-entrained concrete ? What are the
air-entraining agents ? What are factors affecting the air-
entrainment in the concrete ?
Answer
A.
Air-Emtrained Concrete :
1.
Air-entrainment is the internal creation of tiny air bubbles in concrete.
A concrete maker introduces the bubbles by adding to the mix an air
entraining agent. The air bubbles are created during mixing of the
plastic concrete and most of them survive to be part of the hardened
concrete.
2.
It contains billions of microscopic air cells per cubic font. These nir pockets
relieve internal pressure on the concrete by providing tiny chambers for
water to expand into when it freezes.
3.
It is produced using air-entraining Portland cement, or by the introduction
of air-entraining agents, under careful engineering supervision, as the
concrete is mixed on the job.
4.
The amount of entrained air is usually between four to seven percent of
the volume of the concrete.
B.
Air-entraining Agents : Following are the air-entrainment agent used
in the concrete :
1.
Natural wood resins.
2.
Animal and vegetable fats and oils such as tallow, olive oil and their fatty
acids such as stearic and oleic acids.
3.
Various wetting agents such as alkali salts or sulphonated organic
compounds.
4.
Water soluble soaps of resins acid.
5.
Miscellaneous materials such as sodium salts of petroleum sulphonic
acids, hydrogen peroxide and aluminium powder, etc.

initiators is used for polymerization process in these systems.
Que 2.8.
Discuss the role of plasticizers when used as an
admixture for concrete.
Answer
Role of Plasticizers : Admixtures are used for following purposes :

the same workability.
2.
To achieve the same workability by decreasing the cement content so as
to reduce the heat of hydration in mass concrete.
3.

4.
To incrense the workability so as to ease placing inaccessible locations.
Que 2.9.
Describe the effect of superplasticizer on the properties
of fresh and hardened concrete.
Answer
A.
Effect on Fresh Concrete:
1.
Superplasticizers enhance workability. The effect depends on type,
dosage, and time of addition (best with mixing water). Water requirement
is reduced by 15 to 30 %6. Resulting concrete has higher strength and
lower permeability.
2.
Superplasticizers produce higher than normal workability for 30-60 min
and there will be rapid loss of workability.
3.
Generally bleeding is decreased (less water). If flowing concrete is made,
precautions are needed not to induce bleeding and segregation
B.
Effect on Hardened Concrete :
1.
Water reduction allows producing high-strength concrete.
2.
Shrinkage of superplasticized concrete is comparable to or less than
normal concrete.
3.
Creep of superplasticized concrete is similar to that of a reference
concrete.
4.
The use of superplasticizers allows improvements in the bond between
concrote and reinforcing steel.
C.
Effect on Durability :
1.
Lower water/cement ratio leads to lower permeability and enhanced
strength and durability.
2.
In normal concrete, the critical spacing between air bubbles is 200 um.
In superplasticized concrete, that value is exceeded. Better freeze-thaw
durability can be expected for air entrained superplasticized concrete.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-8 D (CE-Sem-5)
Chemical and Mineral Admixtures
3.
Durability to sulphate attack depends on the particular mechanism of
sulphate attack and exposure type. For expansion, lower permeability
(less surface penetration) can lead to better durability.
4.
Lower water/cement ratio leads to lower permeability and improved
resistance to chloride penetration and corrosion of steel.
5.
Lower water/cement ratio leads to lower moisture penetration, which
could enhance resistance to alkali expansion.

concrete ?
Answer
Effects of Fly Ash on Concrete : Following are the effects of fly ash
on concrete :
1.
On Amount of Mixing Water :
i.
The use of fly ash in limited amounts as a replacement for cement or as
an addition to cement requires a little more water for the same slump
because of fineness of the fly ash.

What are its benefits and also write down the chemical composition
of the slag GGBS.
Answer
A.
Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) :
1.
The blast furnace slag is a byproduct of the iron manufacturing industry.
Iron ore, coke and limestone are fed into the furnace and the resulting
molten slag floats above the molten iron at a temperature of about
1500 °C to 1600 °C.
Scanned with CamScanner
2-14 D (CE-Sem-5)
Chemical and Mineral Admixtures
2.
The molten slag has n composition of about 30' % to 40' % SiO2 and about
40 % CaO, which is close to the chemical composition of Portland cement.
B.
Benefits of GGBS in Concrete :
1.
Hent of Hydration : Gradual hydration of GGBS with cement generates
lower heat than Portland cement. This reduces thermal gradients in the
concrete.
2
Water Demand : GGBS is a glassy material and its smoother surface
requires less water to adequately cover the particles.
3.
Setting Time : Increased setting time may be advantageous in extending
the time for which the concrete remains workable and, may reduce the
risk of cold joints.
4. Appearance
i.
GGBS cement also produces a smoother, more defect free surface, due
to the fineness of the GGBS particles.
ii.
GGBS is effective in preventing efflorescence when used at replacement
levels of 50 % to 60 %.
-
5.
Bleeding : GGBS reduce bleeding than that of Portland cement and
therefore reduces risk of delaminations.
6.
Workability : GGBS particles are less water absorptive than Portland
cement particles and thus GGBS concrete is more workable than
Portland cement concrete. For equivalent workability, a reduction in
water content of up to 10% is possible.
7.
Sulphate Resistance : GGBS is n sulphate-resisting. specifying GGBS
at 50 %-70% content gives optimum protection against sulphate attack.
8.
Alkali Aggregate Reaction (AAR) : GGBS reduce the deleterious
effect of AAR due to its low reactive alkali content and its ability to
inhibit AAR.

Answer
Concrete Mix Design : Mix Design is the science of determining the
relative proportions of the ingredients of concrete to achieve the desired
properties in the most economical way.
Types of Mixes : Following are the types of mixes :
1. Nominal Mixes : In the specifications for concrete prescribed the
proportions of cement, fine and coarse aggregates. These mixes of
fixed cement aggregate ratio which ensures adequate strength are
termed nominal mixes
2
Standard Mixes : IS 456-2000 has designated the concrete mixes into
a number of grades as M10, M15, M20, M25, M30, M35 and M40. In this
designation the letter M refers to the mix and the number to the
specified 28 day cube strength of mix in N/mm²
3.
Design Mixes : In these mixes the performance of the concrete is
specified by the designer but the mix proportions are determined by
the producer of concrete, except that the minimum cement content
can be laid down
Objective of Mix Design : Following are the objective of mix design :
1.
To achieve the designed/desired workability in the plastic stage.

ni.
Depending upon the degree of control available at site, the concrete
mix is to be designed for n target mean compressive strength (i.)
applying suitable standard deviation.
2
Type of Cement :
i.
The higher the strength of cement used in concrete, lesser will be the
cement content.
ii.
The use of 43 grade and 53 grade of cement. gives saving in cement
consumption as much as 15 T and 25 T respectively, as compared to 33
grade of cement
3
Maximum Nominal Size of Aggregates :
i.
It is designated by the sieve size higher than larger size on which 15 T
or more of the aggregate is retained.
ii.
The maximum nominal size of aggregate should not be more than
one-fourth of minimum thickness of the member.
iii.
For heavily reinforced concrete members as in the case of ribs of main
beams, the nominal maximum size of the aggregate should usually be
restricted to sum less than the minimum clear distance between the
main bars or 5 mm less the minimum cover to the reinforcement,
whoever is smaller.
4.
Grading of Combined Aggregates :
i.
The relative proportions of the fine and coarse aggregate in a concrete
mix is one of the important factors affecting the strength of concrete.
ii.
For dense concrete, it is essential that the fine and coarse aggregate be
well graded.
5.
Maximum Wnter/Cement Ratio : The lower the wnter/cement ratio,
the greater is the compressivo strength.
6.
Workability : Workability of fresh concrete determines the case with
which a concrete mixture can be mixed, transported, placed, compacted
and finished without harmful segregation and bleeding.
7. Durability :
i.
Durability require low wnter/cement ratio.
ii.
It is usually achieved not by increasing the cement content, but by
lowering the water demands nt given cement content.
iii.
Water demand can be lowored by through control of the aggregate
grading and by using water reducing admistures.

homogeneous dispersion by matrix, and random sampling shows the
same particle size distribution during transportation, placing and
compaction.

Fig. 3.9.1. Parameters the rheology of fresh concrete.
il
The stability of concrete is measured by its segregation and bleeding
characteristirs.
2 Mobility =
i
The mobility of fresh concrete is its ability to flow under momentum
transfer. iEM under mechanical stresses. The flow is restricted by
cohesive, viscous and frictional forces.
il
The cobesive force develops due to adhesion between the matrix and
aggregate particles. It provides tensile strength of fresh concrete that
resists segregation.
Ei. The viscosity of the matrix contributes to the ease with which the
aggregate particles can move and rearrange themselves within the
matrix.
iv.
The internal frietion occurs when a mizture is displaced and the
agregate particles translate and rotate.
v.
The resistance to deformation depends on the shape and texture of the
agregate, the richness of the mixture, the water-cement ratio, and
the type of cement used.
3
Compactability :
il
It measures the ear with which freah concrete is compacted.
il Comparting consist of expelling entrapped air and repositioning the
agregate particles in a denne mass without causing segregation.
Ti
Compastability is measured by the compacting factor test.

Describe the Bingham model of Rheology of fresh
concrete.
Answer
1.
The flow behaviour of fresh concrete does not conform to Newtonian
liquid.
2.
The ratio of shear stress to shear rate is not constant but depends upon
the shear rate at which it is measured, and may also depend on the
shear history of the concrete sample being investigated.
3.
However, at low shear rates that are important in practice, the
behaviour can be represented by a straight line which does not pass
through-the origin, i.e., which has an intercept on the stress axis.
4.
The intercept indicates the minimum stress below which no flow occurs.
5.
The fact that concrete can stand in a pile (as in the case of the slump
test) suggests that there is some minimum stress necessary for flow to
occur at all.
6.
The minimum stress is called yield stress and designated by the symbol
To Thus the simplest flow equation of concrete illustrated in

To stablish a straight line, at least two points are required. Accordingly,
the workability of concrete cannot be defined by the single-point tests
that determine only one parameter, i.e., produce only single point, and
therefore have to be used in combination with other tests to achieve a
better understanding of concrete rheology.
10. For example, the Vee-Bee test can be used with compacting factor test
to measure mobility and compactability.
Que 3.11.
Explain the affective factors of rheological properties
of concrete.
Answer
Following are the affecting factors of rheological properties of concrete :
1.
Mix Proportion : A concrete mix having an excess amount of coarse
aggregate willlack sufficient mortar to fill the void system, resulting in
a loss of cohesion and mobility.
2
Consistency The consistency of concrete, as measured by the slump
test, is an indicator of the relative water content in the concrete mix.
3
Hardening and Stiffening :
i
Elevated temperature, use of rapid-hardening cement, cement deficient
in gypsum, and use of accelerating admixtures, increase the rate of
hardening which reduces the mobility of concrete.
il
The dry and porous aggregate will rapidly reduce workability by
absorbing water from the mixture or increasing the surface area to be
wetted.
4.
Aggregate Shape and Texture :
i.
The rough and highly angular aggregate particles will result in higher
percentage of voids being filled by mortar, requiring higher fine
aggregate contents and correspondingly higher water content.
ii.
Similarly, an angular fine aggregate will increase internal friction in
the concrete mixture and require higher water content than
well-rounded natural sand.
5.
Aggregate Grading: A well-graded aggregate gives good workability.
These effects are greater in the fine aggregate than in coarse aggregate.
6.
Maximum Aggregate Size : An increase in the maximum size of
aggregate will reduce the fine aggregate content required to maintain a
given workability. and will thereby reduce the surface area to be wetted.
7.
Admixtures : The admixtures which have significant effect on the
rheology of concrete are plasticizern and muper-plusticizers, air-
entraining agents, acceleratorn and retarders.

types of concrete and the rheological parameters.
For Example :
i.
Compared to reference concrete, a wet concrete can be produced by
decreasing both yield stress and plastic viscosity, whereas a stiffer
concrete can be produced by increasing the yield stress.

From ACI 211. 1: 1991, for n alumpof 50 mm, 20 mm maximum aize of
nggregate, for non-nir-entrained concrete, the mixing water content is
185 kg/m² of concrete. Also the approximate entrapped air content is
2%.
The required cement content = 185 =t 394 kg/m³
0.47
4.
From ACI 211.1 : 1991, for 20 mm coarse aggregate, for finenesa
modulus of 2.80, the dry rodded bulk volume of coarse aggregate is
0.62 per unit. volume of concrete.
5.
Therefore the weight of coarse nggregate = 0.62 x 1600 = 992 kg/m³.
6.
From ACI 211.1 1991, the first eatimate of density of fresh concrete
for 20 mm maximum size of aggregate and for non-air-entrained
concrete = 2355 kg/m³.
7.
The weight of all the known ingredient of concrete
Weight of water = 185 kg/m³
Weight of cement = 394 kg/m³
Weight of CA = 992 kg/m³
Weight of FA = 2355 - (185 + 394 + 992) = 784 kg/m³
8.
Alternatively the weight of FA can also be found out by absolute volume
method which is more accurate, as follows :

Total absolute volume = 697 x 10³ cm³
Therefore absolute volume of FA = (1000 - 697) x 10³ = 303 x 10³ cm³
Weight of FA = 303 x 2.65 = 803 kg/m³
9.
Estimated quantities of materials per cubic meter of concrete are :
Cement = 394 kg

The above quantity is on the basis that both FA and CA are in saturated
and surface dry condition.

Target Mean Strength :
Characteristic
Target mean strength,f ck = fert 1.65 x a = 45 + 1.65 x 5 = 53.25 N/mm²
Where a is the standard deviation taken as 5 N/mm².
2.
Water/Cement Ratio :
i.
Water/Cementratio is taken from the experience of the mix designer
based on his experience of similar work elsewhere.
W/C ratio = 0.42
ii.
This water cement ratio is to be selected both from strength
consideration and maximum w/c denoted in Table 5 of IS 456 and
lesser of the two is to be adopted durability requirement.
iii. W/C proposed is 0.42. This being lesser than 0.45, we should adopt
W/C ratio as 0.42.
3.
Selection of Water Content :
i.
Maximum water content as per table 3.8.3 is 186 litre. This is for 50 mm
slump.
ii.
Estimated water content for 125 mm slump
9
= 186 x
+ 186 = 203 litre
100
(3 % increase for every 25 mm slump over and above 50 mm slump)
iii.
Really speaking separate trials are required to be done to find out the
efficiency of plasticizers.
iv.
In the absence of such trial, it is assumed that the efficiency of super
plasticizer used 25 percent. Therefore actual water to be used
= 203 x 0.75 = 152 litre.
4.

out to be 0.62
il
In the present case w/c 0.42i.e. it is less by 0.08. As the w/c is reduced
it is desirable to increase the coarse aggregate proportion to reduce the
fine aggregate content.
iii.
The coarse aggregate is increased at the rate of 0.01 for every decrease
in w/c ratio of 0.05.

Volume of CA = 0.62 = 0.016

iv.
Corrected proportion of volume of CA = 0.636
Since it is angular aggregate and the concrete is to be pumped, the
coarse aggregate can be reduced by 10 %.

Questions-Answers
Long Answer Type and Medium Answer Type Questions
Que 4.1.
Explain the various steps in the manufacturing of
concrete.
Answer
Tha various stages in the manufacture of concrete are as follows :
1.
Batching of Concrete : Batching is the process of measuring concrete
max ingrediente by either mass or volume and introducing them into the
mixer To produce concrete of uniform quality, the ingredients must be
measured accurately for each batch.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
4-3 DICE-Sem-5)
The twn methods of batching are as follows
i.
Volume Batching :
a.
Volume batching is not a gond method because of the inaccuracies it
introduces in the measurement of granular materials
b.
Loose sand in a moist condition occupies more volume than dry compacted
sand due to the phenomenon of bulking. Hence, the effect of bulking
must be considered while measuring sand.
c.
Despite drawbacks, for less important non-engineered small works.
this method is adopted because of its ease in application. However. it is
unscientific and hence not recommended for important works.
ii.
Weigh Batching :
a.
Weigh batching is the correct method of measuring the materials that
are used to make concrete.
b.
Use of weigh batching system facilitates accuracy, flexibility. and
simplicity.
c.
For large works, a weigh batching plant is used.
2
Mixing The mixing should ensure that the mass becomes homogeneous,
uniform in colour and consistency.
Methods of Mixing :
i.
Hand mixing.
ii.
Machine mixing.
3.
Transporting : It is the process of transferring of concrete from the
mixing plant to the construction site. It can be done by following
equipments :
i.
Mortar Pan : Concrete is carried in small quantities.
ii.
Wheelbarrows and Buggies : Short flat hauls on all types of onsite
concrete construction.
iii. Cranes and Buckets : Used for work above ground level, buckets use
with cranes, cableways, and helicopters.
4.
Compaction of Concrete :
i.
Compaction of concrete is process adopted for expelling the entrapped
air from the concrete.
ii.
In the process of mixing, transporting and placing of concrete air is
likely to get entrapped in the concrete.
iii.
It has been found from the experimental studies that 1 : air in the
concrete approximately reduces the strength by if
5.
Curing :
i.
It is the process in which the concrete is protected from loss of moisture
and kept within a reasonable temperature range.
Scanned with CamScanner
D(CE-Sem-5)
Concrete Production, Properties and Testing
il The result of this process is increased strength and decreased
permeability.
iii. Curing is also a key player in mitigating cracks in the concrete, which
severely impacts durability.
6. Finishing :
i.
The finish can be strictly functional or decorative.
n
Finishing makes concrete attractive and serviceable.
iil.
The final texture, hardness, andjoint pattern on slabs, floors, sidewalks,
patios, and driveways depend on the concrete's end use.
Que 4.2.
Explain the mixing and transporting operations of
concrete in a work site.
Answer
A
Methods of Mixing : Concrete is mixed either by hand mixing or by
machine mixing. based on the quantity of concrete required.
1.
Hand Mixing :
i.
Mixing by hand is employed only for specific cases where quality is not of
much importance, either because of the unimportant nature of the
work or because the quantity of concrete required is less.
n
Hand mixing generally does not produce uniform concrete and hence
should not be normally used. unless it is for very small domestic works.
2
Mechanical Mixing =
il
Mechanical mixers can be divided into two main types : batch mixer and
continuous mixers.
il
Batch mixers produce concrete batch by batch, one batch at a time. The
operation is intermittent. The raw material is loaded at one end and the
concrete is discharged at the other end. This constitutes a cycle of
operation which is repeated until enough quantity of concrete is
produced
iii.
Continuous mixers produce concrete at a specified rate. The raw materials
are continuously entered at one end and mixed concrete exits from the
delivery end.
B. Transportation of Concrete : The following methods are used for
transporting concrete :
1.
Direct Discharge into Forms by Short Chutes
:
i.
Short chutes in a semi-circular shape stiffened at intervals are simple
and economical to use.
ii.
Free fall of concrete from a height of more than 2 m must be avoided.
2
Barrows :
i.
Manual wheelbarrows of approximately 80 kg capacity can be used for
long horizontal distances.

Concrete Technology
45 D (CE-Sem-5)
ii.
For major works, power barrows of 800 kg capacity, up to 300 m hauls
are used.
3.
Dumpers and Trucks :
i.
These are used for horizontal long hauls.
ii.
Because of jolting, especially if the terrain is rough, the concrete during
transit has the risk of segregation.
4.
Elevating Towers and Hoist : In multi-storied buildings, elevating
towers are used for lifting concrete buckets. The lifted concrete is then
distributed by either chutes or barrows. This type of transportation can
be used where high lifts are required.
5.
Monorail System :
i.
In tunnels and in dam sites, a single track is laid to carry a monorail
power wagon which moves at a speed of 80 m/min.
ii.
This type of transportation can be used for covering long distances.
6.
Cranes and Cableways :
i.
When concreting is to be done in a large project covering mountains and
valleys, cranes and cableways are used to provide three-dimensional
transport enabling both horizontal and vertical movement.
ii.
Depending on the site condition, the type of crane can be chosen. It may
be a derrick, crawler, or wheel mounted.
7.
Belt Conveyor :
i.
It can be used when hauling concrete over long distances.
ii.
It is not very much recommended because of its vulnerability to
segregation.
iii.
The initial setting-up cost is also high. Discharge can be as high as
115 m³/h.
8.
Concrete Bucket and Skip : The capacity of the skip varies from
about 0.2 m³ to 10 m³.
Que 4.3.
What are the precautions to be taken while transporting
concrete ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of concrete
pump ?
Answer
A.
Precautions in Transporting of Concrete : Following precautions
should be used during transporting of concrete :
1.
While water is added to cement, the procedure of hydration starts and
with the passage of time, so concrete should be transported as fast as
possible to the formwork within the initial setting time of cement.
2.
The procedure of mixing, transporting, placing and compacting concrete
should not take more than 90 minutes in any case.

S.
No water shall be lost from the mix during transportation.
4.
The concrete combine should be protected from drying in hot weather
and from rain during transport from the place of mixing to the position
of placing.
5.
Segregation of concrete should be avoided under all circumstances.
6.
The concrete shall be kept agitated in truck mixer in order to avoid it
from becoming stiffif more time is likely to be spent during transportation.
B. Advantages of Concrete Pump :
1. Concrete pumping is a faster and easier method to complete a project.
2
Concrete pumping reduces labour costs.
3.
It reduces site congestion as there are less construction workers.
4.
It provides a steady work pace, increasing productivity.
5. It is effective and economical for various sized projects, including
residential and commercial.
6.
Several pumps can pour simultaneously for larger projects.
C.
Disadvantages of Concrete Pump :
1.
Possibility of a concrete pump breaking down.
2
Risk of injury to construction workers and damage to property.
3.
During busy periods it is not always easy to find a concrete pump that is
available.
Que 4.4.
Define workability. What are the factors affecting the
workability of concrete ?
Answer
A.
Workability of Concrete :
i.
A concrete is said to be workable if it is easily transported, placed,
compacted and finished without any segregation.
ii
Workability is a property of freshly mixed concrete, and a concrete is a
mixture of cement, aggregate, water and admixture.
B.
Factors Affecting of Workability of Concrete : Following are the
factors affecting of workability of concrete :
1.
Water Content : Workability of concrete increases with increase in
water content.
2
Aggregate/Cement Ratio : The higher the aggregate/cement ratio,
the leaner is the concrete, resulting in lesser workability.
3.
Size of Aggregate: For a given quantity of water and paste, bigger size
of aggregates will give higher workability.
4.
Shape of Aggregate : Better workability is ensured to rounded
aggregate than angular, elongated or flaky aggregate.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
4-7 D (CE-Sem-5)
5.
Grading of Aggregate : This is one of the factors which will have
maximum influence on workability. A well graded aggregate can lead to
good workability.
G-
Surface Texture of Aggregate : Rough textured aggregate will show
poor workability and smooth or glassy textured aggregate will give better
workability.
7.
Use of Admixture : The right way of improving workability is to use
chemical admixtures such as plasticizers, super plasticizers, air entraining
agents, etc.
Que 4.5.
Mention the different tests which are commonly adapted
to measure workability and explain any one test in detail.
Answer
A.
Test for Measure Workability : Following are the test used for
measure workability :
i.
Slump test.
ii.
Compacting factor test.
iii.
Vee-Bee test.
B.
Concrete Slump Test Procedure :
1.
Firstly, the internal surface of the mould is cleaned carefully. Oil can be
applied on the surface.
2.
The mould is then placed on a base plate.
3.
The mould is filled with fresh concrete in three layers. Each layer is
tamped 25 times with a steel rod.
4.
After filling the mould, excess concrete should be removed and the
surface should be leveled.
5.
Then the mould is lifted gently in the vertical direction and then
unsupported concrete will slump. The decrease in height at the centre
point is measured to nearest 5 mm or 0.25 inch and it is known as
"slump'.
Que 4.6.
How do you conduct compacting factor test in
laboratory.
Answer
Compaction Factor Test :
1.
The compaction factor test gives the behavior of fresh concrete under
the action of external force.
2.
In this test, the compaction achieved through a free fall of concrete
determines its workability.
Scanned with CamScanner
4-D<CE-Sem-5)
Concrete Production, Properties and Testing
Compaction Factor Test Procedure :
1.
The concrete sample is placed in the upper hopper.
2.
Then the door of hopper is opened. The sample drops into lower hopper
filling it to overflowing
3.
The trap door of the lower hopper is then opened and the sample falls
into the cylinder which is also filled to overflowing.
4.
The surplus concrete is removed from the top of the cylinder with the
help of a trowel.
5.
The outside surface of cylinder is wiped and cleaned.
6.
The cylinder is then weighed and it is recorded as weight of partially
compacted concrete.
7.
The cylinder is again filled with concrete in layers not exceeding 50 mm
in thickness. Each layer is fully compacted with tamping rod.
&.
The cylinder is again weighed after wiping and cleaning the outside
surface of cylinder. This weight is recorded as the weight of fully
compacted concrete.
9.
The compacting factor is then calculated from the formula :
Compacting factor = Weight of partially compacted concrete/Weight of
fully compacted concrete.
Que 4.7.
Explain the Vee-Bee test of determining workability with
neat sketch.
Answer
1. The test is suitable for stiff concrete mixes having low or very low
workability.
2.
Compared to the slump and compacting factor tests, the Vee-Bee test
has the advantage that the concrete in the test receives a treatment
similar to what it would in actual practice.
3.
The test consists of moulding a fresh concrete cone in a cylindrical
container mounted on a vibrating table (Fig. 4.7.1).
4.
When the concrete cone is subjected to vibration using a standard
vibrator, it starts to occupy the cylindrical container by way of getting
remoulded.
5.
The remoulding is considered complete when the concrete surface
becomes horizontal.
6.
The time (in seconds) required for the complete remoulding is considered
as a measure of workability and is expressed as the number of Vee-Bee
seconds.
7.
The end point of the test, when the concrete surface becomes horizontal,
has to be ascertained visually.

Que 4.8.
What is the effect of time and temperature on
workability ?
Answer
A.
Effect of Time on Workability :
1.
Freshly mixed concrete stiffens with the passage of time. This is different
from the hardening of the mix.
2.
As time passes, water is lost due to absorption by aggregates if they are
not already saturated. Some water is lost due to evaporation, especially
if the concrete is exposed to hot weather and wind then workability
decrease.
B.
Effect of Temperature on Workability :
1.
When temperature increases, then in the same proportion workability
of fresh concrete decreases.
2.
The reason that stands behind is "when temperature increases then
evaporation rate also increases due to that hydration rate decreases and
hence, concrete will gain strength earlier".
3.
Due to fast hydration of concrete, a hardening comes in concrete and
that decreases the workability of fresh concrete.

Que 4.9.
Write about segregation and its causes. How reduce
segregation of concrete ?
Answer
A.
Segregation : It is defined as the separation of the constituents of a
homogeneous mixture of concrete. It is caused by the differences in
sizes and weights of the constituent particles.
B. Causes of Segregation in Concrete :
1.
Transporting concrete mixes for long distances.
2.
Poorly proportioned mix, where sufficient matrix is not there to bind the
aggregates.
3.
Dropping concrete from more than 1m.
4.
Vibrating concrete for a long time.

Discuss the factors affecting bleeding of concrete.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
4-11 D (CE-Sem-5)
Answer
Factors Affecting Bleeding of Concrete : Following are the factors
that affecting the bleeding of concrete :
1.
Water Content and Water Cement Ratio :
i.
Any increase in the amount of water or water-to-cementitious material
ratio results in more available water for bleeding.
ii.
A one-fifth increase in water content of a normal concrete mixture can
increase bleeding rate more than two and a half times.
2.
Cement :
i.
The type, content and fineness of cement can effect bleeding. As the
fineness of the cement increases, the amount of bleeding decreases.
ii.
Increases in cement content, reduces the water-cement ratio, and also
reduces bleeding.
3.
Supplementary Cementing Materials :
i:
Fly ash, slag. silica fume, rice husk ash and natural pozzolanas can
reduce bleeding by their inherent properties and by increasing the amount
of cementitious materials in a mixture.
4. Aggregate :
i.
Aggregate that contain a high amount of silt, clay or other material
passing the75 um sieve can have a significant effect in reducing bleeding.
5.
Chemical Admixture :
i.
Air-entraining agents have been used largely because the air bubbles
appear to keep the solid particles in suspension.
ii.
Water reducers also reduce the amount of bleeding because they release
trapped water in mixture.
Que 4.11.
How would you reduce bleeding from concrete ?
Answer
Controlling Measures of Bleeding : Following are the controlling
measures of bleeding from concrete :
1.
Proper proportioning of concrete.
2.
A complete and uniform mixing of concrete.
3.
If we can increase the traveling length of water to be bleeded, the
bleeding can be reduced considerably. For this purpose we can use
finely divided pozzolanic materials
4.
An introduction of air-entrainment by using air entraining agent can
reduce bleeding.
5.
The use of finer cement.

Answer
Follewing are the effects of bleeding en concrete properties:
1
Due in bineding ennerete leses its homogeneity.
=
Bleeding is responsible for causing permeability in concrete.
3
This accumulation of water creates e water voids and reduces bond
between the aggregate and cement past. So the strength of concrete
redures
4
Water that accumulates below the reinforcing bars. particularly below
the cranked bars. reduces the bond between the reinforcement and
concrete
3
The bieeding water flews at over the unsupported side of pavement
which causs collapsing of =ides
6.
In pavement construction bleeding water delays surface finishing and
application of curing compound
7. Bieeding causes of "Laitance in concrete' Due to the formation of
Lartano, structures man lose its wearing capacity and decreases its life.
8
Water while moving from bottom to the top. forms continuous channels.
Dar to this channel. concrete becomes permeable and allow water to
move. which forms Water voids in the matrix and reduces the bond
between aggregate and the cement paste.

concrete under conditions of humidity and temperature which are
conduaive to the progressive and proper setting of the constituent
cetment
B.
Importance of Curing : Following are the importance of euring of
concrete
1. To maintain mousture content in the mix for complete hydration of
concrete
2
To maintain uniform temperature of the concrete.

To preserve that properties of concrete, such as impermeability, durability
and strength
4
To reduce the shrinkage of the concrete.
C. Methode of Curing of Concrete: Following are the methods of curing :
Scanned with CamScanner
Comerete Technology
Ponding of Water over the Concrete Surface after it has Set :
1.
This is the most common method ofeuring the ennerete alab IFF pavements
and
consists of stering the water tn a depth of 50 mm on the surface by
constructing small puddle clay bunds all around
Corering the Concrete with Wet Straw or Damp Earth : In this
2
methed the damp earth or sand in layers of 50 mm height are spread
over the surface of concrete pavements. The material is kept moist by
periodical sprinkling of water.
Covering the Concrete with Wet Burlap : The concrete is covered
s
with burlap (coarse jute or hemp) as soon as possible after placing. and
the material is kept continuously moist for the curing period.
4.
Sprinkling of Water :
This is a useful method for curing vertical or inclined surfaces of concrete.
i
The spraying can be done in fine streams through nozzles fixed to a pipe
ii.
spared at set intervals.
ii
Flogging is done in the same way except that the flogging nozzles produce
a mist-like effect. whereas spraying nozzles shed out fine spray.
Covering the Surface with Waterproof Paper
:
5.
i.
Waterproof paper prevents loss of water in concrete and protects the
surface from damage.
il
A good quality paper can be often reused. The paper is usually made of
two sheets struck together by rubber latex composition.
6.
Leaving the Shuttering or Formwork : The thick watertight
formwork also prevents the loss of moisture in concrete and helps in
curing the sides and the base of the concrete.
7.
Membrane Curing of the Concrete :
i.
The process of applying a membrane forming compound on concrete
surface is termed membrane curing.
ii
Often, the term membrane is used not only to refer to liquid membranes
but also to a solid sheeting used to cover the concrete surface.
iil.
The curing membrane serves as a physical barrier to prevent loss of
moisture from the concrete to be cured.
iv. A curing liquid membrane should dry within 3 to 4 hours to form a
continuous coherent adhesive film free from pinholes and have no
deleterious effect on concrete.
8.
Chemical Curing :
i.
Chemical curing is accomplished by spraying the sodium silicate (water
glass) solution on concrete surface.
n
About 500 K of sodium silicate mixed with water can cover 1 m² of
surface and from a hard and insoluble calcium silicate film.

Answer
Maturity of Concrete :
1.
The strength of concrete depends on both the period of curing (i.e. age
and temperature during curing, the strength can be visualized as a
function of period and temperature of curing.
2.
The maturity of concrete is defined as the summation of product of time
and temperature.
Maturity = (Time x Temperature)

What are the affecting factors of modulus of elasticity of
concrete ?
Answer
Following are the factor affecting the modulus of elasticity of concrete :
1.
Coarse Aggregate Properties : Coarse aggregate properties like elastic
modulus of aggregate, type of aggregate (crushed or natural), petrology
and mineralogy, and quantity of aggregate. The higher the volume of
aggregate in the mix, the higher the elastic modulus.
2

Que 4.24.
Discuss the relationship between modulus of elasticity
and strength concrete.
Answer
Relation between Modulus of Elasticity and Strength of
Concrete :
1.
Modulus of elasticity of concrete is a key factor for estimating the
deformation of structural elements, as well as a fundamental factor for
determining modular ratio, n, which is used for the design of structural
members subjected to flexure.
2.
The modulus of elasticity of concrete is directly proportional to the square
root of characteristic compressive strength in the range of normal
concrete strength,
3.
The IS 456 : 2000 gives the modulus of elasticity of concrete as :

E = Modulus of elasticity.
fer = Characteristic strength of concrete.
Que 4.25.
Explain the procedure for determining the dynamic
modulus of elasticity using ultrasonic pulse velocity equipment.
Answer
Test for Determining Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity :
1.
In this method pulses of compression waves are generated by an electro-
acoustical transducer that is held in contact with one surface of the
prismatic or cylindrical concrete specimen.
2.
After traversing through the concrete, the pulses are received and
converted into electrical energy by a second transducer located at a
distance L from the transmitting transducer.

What is creep ? What are the factors influencing creep of
concrete ?
Answer
Creep :
1.
When concrete is subjected to compressive loading it deforms
instantaneously. This immediate deformation is called instantaneous
strain. Now, if the load is maintained for a considerable period of time,
concrete undergoes additional deformations even without any increase
in the load. This time-dependent strain is termed as creep.
Factor Affecting Creep : Following are the factors affecting creep of
concrete :
1.
Concrete Mix Proportion :
i.
Creep increases with increase in water/cement ratio.
ii.
A poorer paste structure undergoes higher creep.
iii.
The amount of paste content and its quality is one of the most important
factors influencing creep.
iv. Creep is inversely proportional to the strength of concrete.
2.
Aggregate Properties :
i
Light weight aggregate shows substantially higher creep than normal
weight aggregate.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
4-25 D (CE-Sem-5)
The higher the modulus of elasticity the less is the creep.
ii.
iii.
Aggregates influence creep of concrete through a restraining effect on
the magnitude of creep.
3.
Age nt Loading :
i.
Age at which a concrete member is loaded will have a predominant
effect on the magnitude of creep.
ii.
The moisture content of the concrete being different at different age
also influences the magnitude of creep.
4.
Curing Condition : Larger the curing smaller the creep.
5.
Cement Properties :
i.
The type of cement effects creep in so far as it influences the strength of
the concrete at the time of application of load.
ii.
Fineness of cement affects the strength development at early ages and
thus influences creep.
ii.
The finer the cement the higher its gypsum requirement so that re
grinding of cement in laboratory without the addition of gypsum produces
an improperly retarded cement, which exhibits high creep.
6
Temperature :
i.
The rate of creep increases with temperature up to about 70 °C when,
for a 1:7 mix and 0.6 w/c ratio. It is approximately 3.5 times higher than
at 21°C.
ii.
Between 70 °C and 96 °C it drops off to 1.7 times than at 21 °C.
iii. As far as low temperature is concerned, freezing produces a higher
initial rate of creep but it quickly drops to zero.
iv. At temperature between 10 °C and 30 °C, creep is about one half of
creep at 21 °C.
7.
Stress Level :
i.
Higher the stress higher will be the creep.
ii.
There is no lower limit of proportionality because concrete undergoes
creep even at very low stress.
Que 4.27.
What is the effect of creep on concrete structures ?
Answer
Effects of Creep on Concrete Structures :
1.
In reinforced concrete beams, creep increases the deflection with time
and may be a critical consideration in design.
2.
In eccentrically loaded columns, creep increases the deflection and can
lead to buckling.
3.

4.
Creep property of concrete will be useful in all concrete structures to
reduce the internal stresses due to non-uniform load or restrained
shrinkage.
5.
In mass concrete structures such as dams, on account of differential
temperature conditions at the interior and surface, creep is harmful and
by itself may be a cause of cracking in the interior of dams.
Que 4.28.
Explain how creep is measured ?
Answer
Calculating Creep of Concrete :
1.
The creep strain-stress relation in concrete is commonly taken to be
,= $0
where is called the specific creep.
2.
The concept of specific creep is useful for comparing the creep of different
concrete specimens at different stress levels. A typical value of $ is
approximately 150 MPa, = 10-6.
3.
Later the American Concrete Institute (ACI) has developed a simplified
creep equation of the form :
E. E, = B +
where, t = Time.
B = Constant that depends on the age of the concrete before
loading.
Cull = Ultimate creep coefficient, Cull = 2.35.
Que 4.29.
What is shrinkage of concrete ? Explain about
classification of shrinkage.
Answer
A. Shrinkage :
1. Shrinkage of concrete is the time-dependent strain measured in an
unloaded and unrestrained specimen at constant temperature.
2.
Shrinkage is shortening of concrete due to drying and is independent of
applied loads.
B. Types of Shrinkage : Following are the various types of shrinkage :
1.
Plastic Shrinkage :
i.
Plastic shrinkage occurs very soon after pouring the concrete in the
forms.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
4-27 D (CE-Sem-5)
ii.
The hydration of cement results in a reduction in the volume of concrete
due to evaporation from the surface of concrete, which leads to cracking.
2
Drying Shrinkage :
i
The shrinkage that appears after the setting and hardening of the
concrete mixture due to loss of capillary water is known as drying
shrinkage.
ii.
Drying shrinkage generally occurs in the first few months and decreases
with time.
3.
Carbonation Shrinkage :
i
Carbonation shrinkage occurs due to the reaction of carbon dioxide
(CO2, with the hydrated cement minerals, carbonating Ca(OH)2 to
CaCO2.
ü.
The carbonation slowly penetrates the outer surface of the concrete.
iii.
This type of shrinkage mainly occurs at medium humidity and results
increased strength and reduced permeability.
4. Autogenous Shrinkage :
i.
Autogenous shrinkage occurs due to no moisture movement from
concrete paste under constant temperature.
ii
It is a minor problem of concrete and can be ignored.
Que 4.30.
What are the different factors affecting of shrinkage.
Answer
Affecting Factors of Shrinkage :
1.
Drying Conditions :
i.
The most important factor is the drying condition or the humidity in the
atmosphere.
ii.
No shrinkage will occur if the concrete is placed in one hundred percent
relative humidity.
2 Time :
i.
The shrinkage rate will decrease rapidly with time.
ü.
It has been documented that 14 to 34 % of the 20 year shrinkage will
occur within two weeks of it being poured.
iii.
Within one year of the concrete being poured, shrinkage will be about
66 to 85 % of the 20 year shrinkage.
3.
Water Cement Ratio :
i.
The water to cement ratio will influence the amount of shrinkage that
occurs.
ii.
The concrete's richness also affects the shrinkage.
iii. The process of swelling and then drying affects the concrete's integrity
and the shrinkage.

Que 4.31.
What are the effect of shrinkage on concrete and how is
it reduces ?
Answer
Effects of Shrinkage : Following are the effects of shrinkage on concrete:
1.
Shrinkage of concrete between movement joints causes joints to open
or makes it wider. Therefore joints must be designed to accommodate
the widening caused by shrinkage.
2
Where other materials, such as ceramic tiles, are fixed on top of concrete
surface, shrinkage of the concrete causes relative movement between
the different materials. The resulting stresses can cause failure at the
interface.
3.
If shrinkage is restrained, the concrete is put into tension and when
tensile stress becomes equal to tensile strength, the concrete cracks.
4.
Shrinkage of the concrete causes the concrete to grip reinforcing bars
more tightly. This increases friction between concrete and steel and so
improves bond strength, especially for plain bars
5.
The deflection of flexural members is increased by shrinkage. This
is
because the lightly reinforced compression zone is free to shrink more
than heavily reinforced tension zone.
6.
Shrinkage causes a reduction in pre stressing force.
Prevention of Shrinkage : Following are the measures to be taken to
reduced shrinkage :
1.
Provide sun shades in case of slab construction to control the surface
temperature.
2.
Dampen the subgrade of concrete before placement it is liable to water
absorption but should not over damp.
3.
Try to start the curing soon after finishing.
4. Use chemical admixtures to accelerate the setting time of concrete.
Que 4.32.
What do you mean by Poisson's ratio of concrete.
Answer
Poisson's ratio :
1.
It is determined as the ratio of lateral to longitudinal strain in
compression test and may vary from 0.13 to 0.21.
2.
The Poisson's ratio can also be determined from the fundamental
resonant frequency of longitudinal vibration of concrete specimen using
ultrasonic pulse velocity method.

of chemicals inside the body of concrete.
b.
Moisture can also cause efflorescence on structural surfaces.
c.
Seepage / Leakages cause inconvenience to occupants and
deteriorates structures due to permeable concrete.
iii. Freezing and Thawing Leads to expansion of concrete and cracking.
2.
Chemical Factors :
i.
When we are dealing with durability, chemical attack which results in
volume change, cracking and consequent deterioration of concrete
become a major cause of concern.
ii.
Ice-melting salts cause erosion of concrete.

Que 5.2.
Discuss the guidelines to selection of materials for HSC.
Answer
1.
For the higher target compressive strength of concrete, the maximum
size of concrete selected should be small, so that the concrete can become
more dense and compact and less void ratio.
2
Up to 70 MPa compressive strength can be produced with a good coarse
aggregate of a maximum size ranging from 20 to 28 mm.
3.
To produce 100 MPa compressive strength aggregate with a maximum
size of 10 to 20 mm should be used.

1.
Compressive Strength : The compressive strength of SCC when
compared with normal concrete made for a particular strength is almost
the same. The self-compacting property of SCC has very little effect on
the strength of concrete.
2
Tensile Strength : A comparison between cylinders made of SCC
and normal concrete of the same grade shows that there is no major
difference between them.
3. Bond Strength : The pull-out test carried out to determine the bond
strength of SCC indicates superior bond strength of SCC.
4.
Modulus of Elasticity : The modulus of elasticity for SCC and for
normal concrete is the same.
5.
Freeze-thaw Resistance : The low-strength of SCC has less resistance
to freeze and thaw conditions as compared with low-strength normal
concrete.
6.
Creep : SCC normally is more pasty as compared with normal concrete.
So its creep is slightly higher.
7.
Durability : Durability is slightly higher in SCC because of the
elimination of errors which may occur during placing and compaction
of normal concrete. SCC is likely to have less voids.
8.
Exposure to Fire : SCC has a more compact microstructure. This can
lead to high vapour pressure. So SCC has a higher risk of spalling
when exposed to fire.

What is the necessity fibre reinforced concrete and
explain briefly the factors affecting properties of fibre reinforced
concrete.
Answer
Necessity of Fiber Reinforced Concrete:
1.
It increases the tensile strength of the concrete.
2.
It reduces the air voids and water voids the inherent porosity of gel.
3.
It increases the durability of the concrete.
4.
Fibers such as graphite and glass have excellent resistance to creep,
while the same is not true for most resins.
5.
The differential deformations of concrete and the reinforcement are
minimized.
6.
It has been recognized that the addition of small. closely spaced and
uniformly dispersed fibers to concrete would act as crack arrestor and
would substantially improve its static and dynamic properties.
Factors Affecting the Properties of FRC: Following are the factors
affecting the properties of fibre reinforced concrete :
1.
Volume of Fiber :
i.
Low volume fraction (< 1%) : Used in slab and pavement that have large
exposed surface leading to high shrinkage cracking.
ii.
Moderate volume fraction (between 1 and 2 %): Used in construction
method such as shotcrete and in structures which requires improved
capacity against delamination, spalling and fatigue.
iii.
High volume fraction (> %) : Used in making high performance fiber
reinforced composites.
2.
Aspect Ratio of Fiber :
i.
It is defined as ratio of length of fiber to its diameter (L/d).
ii.
Increase in the aspect ratio upto 75, there is increase in relative strength
and toughness.
iii.
Beyond 75 of aspect ratio, there is decrease in strength and toughness
3.
Orientation of Fibers : Fibers aligned parallel to applied load offered
more tensile strength and toughness than randomly distributed or
perpendicular fibers.
4.
Relative Fiber Matrix :
i.
Modulus of elasticity of matrix must be less than of fibers for efficient
stress transfer.

Workability and Compaction of Concrete : Incorporation of stee)
fiber decreases the workability considerably. This situation adversely
affects the consolidation of fresh mix. Even prolonged external vibration
fails to compact the concrete.
6.
Size of Coarse Aggregate: Fibers also act as aggregate maximum size
of the coarse aggregate should be restricted to 10 mm, to avoid appreciable
reduction in strength of the composite.
7.
Mixing : Mixing of fiber reinforced concrete needs careful conditions to
avoid balling of fibers, segregation and in general the difficulty of mixing
the materials uniformly.

Explain the behaviour of ferro cement under tension.
Answer
Behaviour of Ferro Cement in Tension :
1
The typical load elongation curve for reinforced concrete prism and
ferro cement prism is shown in Fig. 5.16.1 (a) and (b), respectively.
2
The behaviour is mainly divided into three main stages :
L Stage I : Corresponds to the ascending linear elastic portion of the
curve (OA).
ii.
Stage II : Corresponds to the unstable portion (AB) where cracking
starts and stabilizes.
iii. Stage III : Where is load elongation is almost linear elastic and the
crack width increase with an increase in applied load because of cracking.
This stage exists until the reinforcing steel yields. There will be only a
few wide cracks across the steel.
3.
From Fig. 5.16.1, the main difference lies in unstable stage II (AB).
4. Slowly adapts to the increasing load by increasing its extensibility. Many
fine cracks form. When cracks form, the increase in crack width is small
compared to reinforced concrete.
5.
Crack width in ferro cement can be one to two orders of magnitude
smaller than that of reinforced concrete. However, there are a number
of fine cracks.

Explain recycled aggregate concrete. Describe the
various properties of recycled aggregate concrete.
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology
5-25 D (CE-Sem-5)
Answer
Recycled Aggregate Concrete :
1.
Recycled aggregate concrete is simply the old aggregate concrete that
has been removed from buildings foundations pavements and others
-
structures, and crushed to the specified size.
2.
The reuse of broken concrete pieces as coarse aggregate is a proven
technology. Old concrete can be crushed and used in fresh concrete as
partial replacement for conventional natural aggregates.
3.
The old concrete can be from demolition waste (recycled concrete
aggregate) or leftover concrete at aconstruction site (leftover concrete
aggregate).
4.
The fresh concrete leftover at a site can also bé washed free of cement
paste and the aggregates recovered to be used subsequently (recovered
concrete aggregate).
5.
Waste materials from other industries (e.g. broken glass pieces) can be
used as secondary aggregates.
Properties of Recycled Aggregate Concrete:
1.
The concrete produced with recycled aggregate losses its workability
more rapidly than the conventional concrete.
2.
If both fine and coarse aggregates are recycled aggregates, around
15 per cent more free water is required.
3.
An air entraining and water reducing admixture shall be incorporated
into fresh recycled aggregate concrete mix.
4.
The air content of recycled aggregate concrete may be slightly higher
than that of conventional aggregate concretes, it shall be between 3 and
6 per cent.
5.
The slump of recycled coarse aggregate concrete shall not exceed
200 mm.
6.
Water-cement ratio shall not exceed 0.65. Cement content shall not be
less than 260 kg/m¹.
7.
To achieve comparable strength, recycled aggregate concretes requires
approximately 8 to 15 per cent higher cement contents.
8.
The compressive strength of recycled segregate concrete is in the range
of about 75 per cent, and the modulus of elasticity about 65 per cent of
conventional concrete with natural aggregates.
9.
The tensile and flexural strengths are approximately 10 per cent lower.
10. The damping capacity, expressed in terms of logarithmic decrement,
has been reported to be between 15 to 20 per cent higher.
11. The creep and drying shrinkage are 30 to 60 per cent higher.
12. The abrasion resistance for concrete has been found to reduce as
compared to original concrete.

How recycled aggregate produced ? Also give its
applications.
Answer
Production of Recycled Aggregate :
1. The basic method of the recycling is one of crushing the debris to
produce a granular product of given particle size and then reprocessing
and screening, the degree of which depends on the level of contamination
and the application of which recycled aggregate is produced.
2.
Recycled aggregates normally have more angular shape and more
coarser surface and exhibit more or less similar particle size distribution
as that for natural aggregate.
Applications of Recycled Aggregate : The applications of recycled
aggregate in construction areas are as follows :
1.
Aggregate Base Course, or the untreated aggregates used as foundation
for roadway pavement, is the underlying layer which forms a structural
foundation for paving.

Write shorts notes on status of recycled aggregate
concrete in India.
Answer
Recycled Aggregate Use in India :
1.
Currently India has a severe shortage of infrastructural facilities.
Nonetheless India is constructing its foundation at a very fast rate.
2.
In this process of construction and reconstruction it has become the
second largest producer of cement in the world only after China.
3.
Though it is not even in top ten when it comes to production of recycled
aggregate concrete.
4.
Now as the government is gearing up for development of new cities,
buildings, roads etc., the gates are wide open for production of more
recycled aggregate.
5.
Not only the problem of hundreds of thousands of tons of construction
debris can be solved by recycling and reusing the building wastes, but
also the issue of shortage of natural aggregates can be addressed.
6.
Recycled aggregate concrete have several reliable applications. However,
countries like India need to take some serious urgent measures to
unleash the scope of recycled aggregate and if done so, concrete recycling
will become one of the most important elements for construction
sustainability.

of about 1500 °C slakes very slowly, when mixed with water.
b. Describe the mechanism of action of plasticizers with neat
sketch. Mention any three super plasticizers.
Ans
A. Mechanism of Action of Plasticizers : The action of plasticizers
is mainly to fluidify the mix and improve the workability of concrete,
mortar or grout. The mechanisms involved are :
1. Dispersion :
i Portland cement being in fine state will have a tendency to flocculate
in wet concrete, these flocculation entraps certain amount of water
used in the mix.
ii.
When plasticizers are used, they get adsorbed on the cement
particles, creates particle to particle repulsive forces which overcome
the attractive forces.
ni. This repulsive force is called Zeta Potential, which depends on the
base, solid content, quantity of plasticizer used.
iv. When cement particles are deflocculated, the water trapped inside
the flocs gets released and is now available to fluidify the mix.
2.
Lubricating: The agents are organic by nature, thus they lubricate
the mix reducing the friction and increasing the workability.
3. Retarding Effect :
i. Plasticizers get adsorbed on the surface of the cement particles and
form a thin sheath.
ii. This sheath inhibits the surface hydration reaction between water
and cement as long as-sufficient plasticizers molecules are available.
iii. Quantity of plasticizers will decrease as the polymers become
entrapped in hydration products.
The following mechanisms may take place simultaneously :
a. Reduction in the surface tension of water.
b. Induced electrostatic repulsion between particles of cement.
c. Lubricating film between cement particles.
d. Dispersion of cement grains, releasing water trapped within cement
flocs.
e. Inhibition of the surface hydration reaction of the hydration cement
particles, leaving more water to fluidify the mix.

c. Design a concrete mix of M 30 grade. Take standard deviation
5 MPa. The specific gravities of coarse aggregate and fine
aggregate are 2.75 and 2.62 respectively. The bulk density of
coarse aggregate is 1610 kg/m³ and fineness modulus of
aggregate is 2.70. A slump of 60 mm is necessary. The water
absorption of coarse aggregate is 1 % and free moisture in
fine aggregate is 2%. Design the concrete mix using is code
method. Assume any missing data.
Ans.
Given = Standard deviation, a = 5 MPa, Specific gravity of CA
= 2.75, Specific gravity of FA = 2.62, Bulk density of CA=1610
kg/m³, Fineness modulus of aggregate = 2.70, Slump value
= 60 mm, Water absorption of CA = 1 %, Free moisture in
FA = 2 %.
To Find : Design mix M30 grade concrete.
1. Assuming 5 percent of results are allowed to fall below specified
design strength. The mean strength,
fm. = fmin + ko
= 30 + 1.64 x 5 = 38.2 MPa
2. Assume estimated w/c ratio is 0.47.

SP-4 D (CE-Sem-5)
Solved Paper (2018-19)
i. This w/c ratio from strength point of view is to be checked against
maximum w/c ratio given for special exposure condition given in
IS 456 : 2000 and minimum of the two is to be adopted.
ii.
From IS 456 : 2000 the maximum w/c ratio is 0.60.
Therefore, adopt w/c ratio of 0.47.
3. From IS 456 : 2000, for a slump of 60 mm, 20 mm maximum size of
aggregate, for non-air-entrained concrete, the mixing water
content is 185 kg/m³ of concrete. Also the approximate entrapped
air content is 2 %.
The required cement content = 185/0.47, - 394 kg/m³
4. From IS 456 : 2000, for 20 mum coarse aggregate, for fineness
modulus of 2.60, the dry rodded bulk volume of coarse aggregate
is 0.62 per unit volume of concrete.
5.
Therefore the weight of coarse aggregate = 0.62 x 1610
= 998.2 kg/m³.
6. From IS code, the first estimate of density of fresh concrete for
20 mm maximum size of aggregate and for non-air-entrained
concrete = 2355 kg/m³.
7. The weight of all the known ingredient of concrete are :
Weight of water = 185 kg/m³
Weight of cement = 394 kg/m³
Weight of CA = 998.2 kg/m³
Weight of FA = 2355 - (185 + 394 + 998.2) = 777.8 kg/m³
8.
Alternatively the weight of FA can also be found out by absolute
volume method which is more accurate, as follows

Weight of materials for one bag mix in kg = 50 : 102 : 126.5 : 23.5
The above quantity is on the basis that both FA and CA are in
saturated and surface dry condition.
11. The proportions are required to be adjusted for the field conditions.
FA has moisture of 2 per cent.
i. Total free surface moisture in FA = (2/100) x 804.34=16.08kg/m²
ii. Weight of FA in field condition
= 804.34 + 16.08 = 820.42 kg/m³ = 821 kg/m³
iii. CA absorbs 1 % water
Quantity of water absorbed by CA = (1/100) x 998.2 = 9.981 kg/m³
iv. Weight of CA in field condition
= 998.2 - 9.982 = 989.2 kg/m³
v.
With regard to water, 16.08 kg of water is contributed by FA and
9.982 kg of water is absorbed by CA.
Therefore 16.08 - 9.982 = 6.1 kg of extra water is contributed by
aggregates. This quantity of water is deducted from total water
185.00 - 6.1 = 178.9 kg/m³ z 179 kg/m³
12. Quantities of materials to be used in the field duly corrected for
free surface moisture in FA and absorption characteristic of CA
Cement = 394 kg/m³
FA = 821 kg/m³
CA = 989 kg/m³
Water = 179 kg/m³
Field density of fresh concrete = 2388 kg/m³
d. What is the relation between creep and time ? What is the
effect of creep on concrete ?

4. Attempt any one part of the following :
(7 x 1 = 7)
a. Describe gas forming agents ? Give an example of a material
in powder form used as a gas forming agent.
Ans. Gas Forming Agent :
1. These admixtures when added to mortar or concrete mixture react
chemically with hydroxides present in the cement and form minute
bubbles of hydrogengas of size ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm throughout
the cement-water matrix.
2. This action, when properly controlled, causes a slight expansion in
plastic concrete or mortar and thus reduces or eliminates voids
caused by normal settlement that occur during the placement of
concrete.
3. Water films around the gas bubbles prevent bleeding.
4. The gas is beneficial in improving the effectiveness of grout for
filling joints, in improving the homogeneity of grouted concrete,
and in filling block outs and openings in concrete structures.
5. Larger amounts of powder increase the expansion appreciably
resulting in a gas-filled lightweight low strength concrete. These
are also called foamed concrete or aerated concrete or cellular
concrete.
Example : Aluminium powder, Hydrogen peroxide, Activated
carbon, etc.
b. Write a note on workability agents. Give examples.
Ans. Workability Agents :
1. The workability of concrete is governed by the amount of aggregate
in the mix. Where reduction of aggregate (or increase in cement) is
impractical, workability is increased by adding a plasticizer.
2. Air-entraining agents, when used, are plasticizers. Other substances
include calcium chloride, lime, fly ash, and other pozzolans.
3. Lime increases the cementing properties of cement, as do pozzolans
combined with lime.
4. Fly ash is inexpensive compared to cement and is used as a partial
replacement (up to as much as 50 percent) of the cement.
5. It changes both the plastic and the hardened properties of concrete.

n. Explain how you would determine the various elastic
moduli for concrete.
Ane Refer Q. 4.24 and Q. 4.25, Page 4-23D; Unit-4.
b. What do you understand by carbonation of concrete ? How
is it tested ?
Ans
1. Carbonation occurs in concrete because the calcium bearing phases
present are attacked by carbon dioxide of the air and converted to
calcium carbonate.
2. Cement paste contains 25-50 % calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) by
weight, which mean that the pH of the fresh cement paste is at
least 12.5.
3. The pH of a fully carbonated paste is about 7.
4. The concrete will carbonate if CO2 from air or from water enters
the concrete according to:
CalOH)2 + CO2
CaCO3 + H2O
5. When Ca(OH)2 is removed from the paste hydrated CSH will liberate
CaO which will also carbonate.
6. The rate of carbonation depends on porosity and moisture content
of the concrete.
7.
The carbonation process requires the presence of water because
CO2 dissolves in water forming H2CO3.
8. If the concrete is too dry (RH < 40%)CO2 cannot dissolve and no
carbonation occurs.
9. If on the other hand it is too wet (RH > 90%) CO2 cannot enter the
concrete and the concrete will not carbonate. Optimal conditions
for carbonation occur at a RH of 50% (range 40-90%).
Test of Carbonation of Concrete
:
1. Carbonation may be recognized in the field by the presence of a
discoloured zone in the surface of the concrete.
2. The colour may vary from light gray and difficult to recognize to
strong orange and easy to recognize.
3.
Carbonation can be visualized by using phenolphthalein.
4. In the optical microscope carbonation is recognized by the presence
of calcite crystals and the absence of calcium hydroxide, ettringite
and un-hydrated cement grains.

6. Attempt any one part of the following
:
(7 x 1 = 7)
n. Write a brief note on flexure strength of concrete.
Anc Flexure Strength of Concrete :
1. The determination of flexural tensile strength is essential to estimate
the load at which the concrete members may crack.
2. As it is difficult to determine the tensile strength of concrete by
conducting a direct tension test, it is computed by flexure testing.
3. The flexural tensile strength at failure or the modulus of rupture is
thus determined and used when necessary.
4. Its knowledge is useful in the design of pavement slabs and airfield
runway as flexural tension is critical in these cases.
5. The modulus of rupture is determine. by testing standard test
specimens of 150 mm x 150 mm x 700 mm over a span of 600 mm
or 100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm over a span of 400 mm, under
symmetrical two-point loading.
6. The modulus of rupture is determined from the moment at failures
asf,=MIZ.
b. Discuss the influence of mix proportions of concrete on
shrinkage.
Anc. Following are the affecting factors of shrinkage :
1. Type of Coarse Aggregates : In general, concretes made with
high moduli of elasticity non-shrinking aggregates will have low
shrinkage.
2 Shape of Aggregates : The size and shape of coarse aggregate
influence the loss of moisture and it has therefore an indirect effect
on the shrinkage of concrete. In general, the smaller the aggregate
size, the more surface area. more water is absorbed as a result and,
therefore, more shrinkage.
3. Hardness of Aggregates : Harder aggregate with higher modulus
of elasticity like quartz shrinks much less than softer aggregates
such as sandstone.
4. Effect of Admixtures : Addition of calcium chloride increases the
shrinkage of concrete generally between 10 to 50 % The plasticizers
which red.ice the water-cement ratio of the concrete, their net
effect on shrinkage is negligible.
5. Chemical Composition of Cement : The chemical composition
of cement has been observed as not having any effect on the
shrinkage of concrete. However cement deficient in gypsum exhibits
a greatly increased shrinkage.
6. Effect of High Alumina Cement : The shrinkage of concrete
made with high alumina cement is of the same magnitude as that
Scanned with CamScanner
Crocrele Technology
SP-11D (CE-Sem-5)
of concrete made with Portland cement, but in case of high alumina
cement shrinkage takes place much more rapidly than when
Portland cement is used.
7. Water Content : The water content affects the water-cement
ratio hence higher the amount of water, greater the shrinkage as
higher the water-cement ratio.
&. Properties of Cement : The properties of cement have little effect
on the shrinkage of concrete. Fineness of cement has no influence
on the shrinkage of concrete. However it increases the shrinkage
of cement paste.
9. Quality of Cement Paste : The quality of cement paste influences
the magnitude of shrinkage. The quality of cement pate is dependent
on the water cement ratio. Higher the w/c ratio, greater the
shrinkage,
7. Attempt any one part of the following :

a. What is the need to study fiber reinforced concrete and
explain briefly the factors effecting properties of fiber
reinforced concrete ?
Ans. Refer Q. 5.8, Page 5-9D, Unit-5.
b. Difference between high performance concrete and high
density concrete.
Ans. High Performance Concrete :
1. High performance concrete is a concrete mixture, which possess
high durability and high strength when compared to conventional
concrete.
2. This concrete contains one or more of cementitious materials such
as fly ash, silica fume or ground granulated blast furnace slag and
usually a super plasticizer.
3. High performance concrete has high strength and low permeability.
4. High performance concrete is not a special type of concrete. It
comprises of the same materials as that of the conventional cement
concrete.
5. The use of some mineral and chemical admixtures like silica fume
and super plasticizer enhance the strength, durability and
workability qualities to a very high extent.
6. It is used in high rise building column, off shore platforms and
heavy-duty floors.
High Density Concrete :
1. Concrete having unit weight of 30 kN/m³ to 64 kN/m³ is called high
density or heavy weight concrete.

Ans Refer Q. 3.4. Page 3-4D, Unit-3.
d. Why it is necessary to add gypsum in the manufacturing of
cement ?
Ans. Role of Gypsum in Cement :
1. The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down
the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water.
2.
The process involved in hydration of cement is that, when the
water is added into cement, it starts reacting with the C.A and
hardens. The time taken in this process is very less, which does not
allow time for transporting, mixing and placing.
3. When gypsum is added into the cement and water is added to it,
reaction with C.A.A particles takes place to form ettringite.
4. This ettringite is initially formed as very fine-grained crystals, which
form a coating on the surface of the C3A particles These crystals
are too small to bridge the gaps between the particles of cement.
The cement mix therefore remains plastic and workable.

5. The time allowed for mixing, transporting and placing plays an
important role in strength, composition and workability of concrete.
As gypsum retards the process of hydration, it is termed as retarding
agent of cement.
e Write the basic principle of ready mix concrete placement
methods.
Ans. Ready mix concrete placement methods include following basic
principles :
1. When arriving to the site, the concrete transport certificate must
be checked for desired characteristics of ordered concrete (quantity,
class, maximum aggregate size, slump, temperature, type of cement
etc.) and time duration of transport.
2. Concrete shall be delivered to the site and discharged from the
truck completely and in the forms ready for vibration within 1-1/2
hours after batching
3. Concrete shall be placed in maximum 15 minutes after its arrival to
the site, and the finishing of placement will take place before the
cement starts setting.
4. Concrete shall be stored / deposited as near as (physically and
economically) possible to its final position, in crane hoisted buckets,
concrete pumps, chutes etc.
5. The receptacles used for the transport and deposition of concrete
shall be cleaned and washed out at the end of each day's work and
whenever concreting is interrupted for more than 30 minutes.
6. If the concrete, due to transport, is segregated. It should be mixed
again on clean platforms, without adding water.
7. As placing begins the consistency of the delivered concrete should
be checked with a slump cone for conformance with specifications
and the required number of samples must be taken (1 sample = 3
specimens) according to the volume of concrete placed.
8. Concrete shall be placed to prevent segregation. The concrete shall
not be permitted to strike against forms and ricochet on bars and
form faces. The free fall of concrete should in no case exceed 1.5 m.
For greater heights, as in walls or columns, metal or rubber hoppers,
chutes or flexible hoses must be lowered into the formwork to
control the rate of fall of the concrete, if not the concrete will flow
rapidly entering the forms invariably resulting separation and
honeycombing.
9. When concrete is dumped from a cart or wheelbarrow, there is a
tendency for the heavier particles to separate from the mass. To
prevent this, the concrete should be discharged against a striking
(baffle) board.

&
Role of Water in Concrete :
Water is the key ingredient, which when mixed with cement, forms
1.
B paste that binds the aggregate together.
2
The water causes the hardening of concrete through a process
called hydration. Hydration is a chemical reaction in which the
major compounds in cement form chemical bonds with water
molecules and become hydrates or hydration products.
3.
The role of water is important because the water to cement ratio is
the most critical factor in the production of "perfect" concrete. Too
much water reduces concrete strength, while too little will make
the concrete unworkable.
4. Concrete needs to be workable so that it may be consolidated and
shaped into different forms (i.e., walls, domes, etc.). Because
concrete must be both strong and workable, a careful balance of
the cement to water ratio is required when making concrete.
B. Source of Aggregate:
1. Almost all natural aggregate materials from bed rocks.
2. There are three kinds of rocks, namely, igneous, sedimentary and
metamorphic.
3. The igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of molten magma or
lava at the surface of the crest (trap and basalt) or deep beneath the
crest (granite).
4. The sedimentary rocks are formed originally below the sea bed and
subsequently lifted up.
5. Metamorphic rocks are originally either igneous or sedimentary
rocks which are subsequently metamorphosed due to extreme heat
and pressure.
Aggregates from Igneous Rocks :
i.
Most igneous rocks make highly satisfactory concrete aggregates
because they are normally hard, tough and dense.
ii. The igneous rocks have massive structure, entirely crystalline or
wholly glassy or in combination in between, depending upon the
rate at which they where cooled during formation.
iii. They may be acidic or basic depending upon the percentage of silica
content. They may occur light coloured or dark coloured.
iv. The igneous rocks as a class are the most chemically active concrete
aggregate and show 11 tendowey to renet with the alkaline in cement.
v. As the ignoous rock is one of the widely occurring type of rocks on
the faco of the earth, bulk of the concrete aggregates, that are
derived, are of igneous origin.

SP-18D (CE-Sem-5)
Solved Paper (2019-20)
Aggregates from Sedimentary Rocks :
i. Igneous rocks or metamorphic rocks are subjected to weathering
agencies such as sun, rain and wind.
il. These weathering agencies decompose, fragmentise, transport and
deposit the particles of rock, deep beneath the ocean bed where
they are cemented together by some of the cementing materials.
iii. The cementing materials could be carbonaceous, siliceous or
argillaceous in nature. At the same time the deposited and cemented
material gets subjected to static pressure of water and becomes
compact sedimentary rock layer.
Aggregates from Metamorphic Rocks :
i. Both igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks may be subjected to
high temperature and pressure which causes metamorphism which
changes the structure and texture of rocks.
ii. The thickness of this foliation may vary from a few centimetres to
many metres.
III. If the thickness of this foliation is less, then individual aggregate
may exhibit foliation which is not a desirable characteristic in
aggregate.
iv. However, many metamorphic rocks particularly quartzite and gneiss
have been used for production of good concrete aggregates.
6. Attempt any one part of the following :
(7x1=7)
a. Describe in detail Vee-Bee consistometer test to determine
workability of concrete.
Anc Refer Q. 4.7, Page 4-8D, Unit-4.
b. Define light weight concrete and explain in detail the
classification of light weight concrete.
Ans. Light Weight Concrete :
1. Light weight concrete mixture is made with a light weight coarse
aggregate and sometimes a portion or entire fine aggregates may
be light weight instead of normal aggregates.
2. Structural light weight concrete has an in-place density (unit
weight) on the order of 1440 to 1840 kg/m³.
3. Normal weight concrete a density in the range of 2240 to
2400 kg/m³.
4. Light weight aggregates used in structural light weight concrete
are typically expanded shale, clay or slate materials that have been
Scanned with CamScanner
Concrete Technology

fired in a rotary kiln to develop a porous structure. Other products
such as air-cooled blast furnace slag are also used.
5. There are other classes of non-structural LWC with lower density
made with other aggregate materials and higher air voids in the
cernent paste matrix, such as in cellular concrete.
Classification of Light weight concrete : There are three broad
classifications of light weight concrete based on the method
employed for production.
1. Light weight Aggregate Concrete : In this method a porous
light weight aggregate of low specific gravity instead of normal
aggregate of specific gravity 2.6 is used.
2. Aerated, Cellular, Foamed or Gas Concrete : Large voids
(Gas bubbles) are introduced into the concrete or mortar to produce
a cellular mass.
3. No-Fines Concrete : In this method the fine aggregates are not
used and only coarse aggregates are used in concrete as a result
large voids are left reducing the density of concrete and hence the
weight.
7. Attempt any one part of the following :
(7 x 1 = 7)
a. Describe recycled aggregate concrete status in India.
Ans: Indian Status :
1. There is severe shortage of infrastructural facilities like houses,
hospitals, roads etc. in India and large quantities of construction
materials for creating these facilities are needed.
2. The planning commission allocated approximately 50 % of capital
outlay for infrastructure development in successive 10th and 11th
five year plans.
3. Rapid infrastructural development such as highways, airports etc.
and growing demand for housing has led to scarcity and rise in cost
of construction materials.
4.
Most of waste materials produced by demolished structures disposed
off by dumping them as landfill. Dumping of wastes on land is
causing shortage of dumping place in urban areas. Therefore, it is
necessary to start recycling and reuse of demolition concrete waste
to save environment, cost and energy.
5. Central Pollution Control Board has estimated current quantum of
solid waste generation in India to the tune of 48 million tons per
annum out of which, waste from construction industry only accounts
for more than 25 %. Management of such high quantum of waste
puts enormous pressure on solid waste management system.
